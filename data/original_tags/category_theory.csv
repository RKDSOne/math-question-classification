"<p>I am trying to understand something about curved dg algebras as studied by Positselski, E. Segal. These come up in mirror symmetry and when one wants to study Kozsul duality for algebras that are more general then those that fit into the classical framework. </p>

<p>Let C denote the complex numbers. Suppose we take a cdg-algebra B that is C[x] with a curving x^2, where x is now a variable in odd degree and so does not fit into the matrix factorization framework.  As I understand the situation, then the Koszul dual of this should be an algebra A which is C[y]/(y^2-1), where y is in even degree.In the framework of Positselski, as I understand it one can compute A as Ext(C,C) and pass back to B by taking the Cobar construction. The curving arises from the fact that the coalgebra dual to A is no longer co-augmented. I think that in this simple example one equivalently can also take a more down to earth approach, as was taken by Dyckerhoff in his paper on matrix factorizations, using explicit Koszul resolutions. </p>

<p>My question is about a confusion I have about the Hochschild cohomology of this dg-category. As I understand it, the Hochschild cohomology of D(B) should be isomorphic to the center of A which is A. Yet if one uses the complex defined in Segal's paper, I believe one gets C[y]/y^2, with y an even variable. The complex he claims should compute HH*(D(B)) is given by the usual Hochschild complex with differential on the algebra B + Gerstenhaber bracket with x^2. To compute, I first computed ordinary HH*(C[x]) and the Gerstenhaber bracket on HH* and then concluded the answer using a spectral sequence. </p>

<p>Segal's justification seems to be that this is what you get when you regard B as a curved A-infinity algebra, but as I understand Positselski, there seems to be some subtelties with this and that one can often end up with no objects in the category. So I was made a little bit nervous by the justification. Most likely everything is ok and I am missing something stupid, but it would be great if someone would be so kind as to point out where my mistake is.      </p>

This is all done to generalize work done in various fields throughout mathematics (e.g. Devinatz, Hopkins, and Smith's work in stable homotopy theory, and Pevtsova and Friedlander's work in finite group schemes). So the classic examples of tensor trianulated categories that Balmer talks about are the category of spectra of some space, the category of $G$-modules for some finite group scheme $G$, or the perfect derived category associated to a (topologically Noetherian) scheme (this is related to Thomalson's work reconstructing a scheme from the aforementioned category).</p>

<p>This setup does not seem to fit nicely into a categorical framework: In the first two examples above, the construction $C$ is not a functor, at least from the usual categories of sets and abelian groups. $C$ is a functor if we only force it to respect isomorphisms (by considering $V$ as a category with invertible morphisms as arrows), but we care about a noninvertible morphism in $W$ (the embedding $B\rightarrow C(U(B))$, so we won't be able to make $U$ into a functor to $V$.

"<p>Every once  in a blue moon  it actually matters that some mathematical entity which might  <em>a priori</em> only be a class is in  fact  a set. For  clarification,  here are some examples of what I  do  <strong>not</strong> mean:  </p>

<p>A) Some colleagues of mine once  made the following disclaimer:  'The ""set"" of stable curves does not exist, but we leave this set theoretic difficulty to the reader.' These colleagues (names withheld to  protect the  innocent) are  of course  fully  aware of  the fact that strictly  speaking, the class of all  stable  curves, or topological  spaces, or  groups, or any the other usual suspects customarily formalized  in  terms of structured sets, cannot itself be  a set. While they recognize that  the  structure they study is transportable along arbitrary bijections between members of a proper class of equinumerous sets, they also recognize that in their setting this  same transportability could justify a  technically sufficient <em>a  priori</em> restriction to some fixed  but otherwise  arbitrary  underlying  set: that is, the relevant large category has a small skeletal  subcategory. (Exercise: precisely what makes this work  in the example given?) In such cases, the set versus class pecadillo is an essentially victimless  one, perhaps barring discussions  of the   admissibility of Choice, expecially  Global  Choice. </p>

<p>B) There are various contexts in which seemingly unavoidable size issues are managed through the device of Grothendieck Universes. Such a move  beyond ZFC might  be regarded as cheating, sweeping the issue under the carpet for all the right reasons. Allegations of this nature regarding the use of derived functor cohomology in number theory, as in the proof  of Fermat's  Last Theorem, can  now be laid to rest, as Colin  McLarty has nicely  shown in ""A finite order arithmetic foundation for cohomology"" <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1773"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1773</a>.</p>

<p>C) Set  theory itself  is  replete with situations  where the set  versus class distinction is of paramount importance.  For just  one  example, my very  limited understanding  is  that forcing over  a  proper class of conditions is not  for the unwary. I'd be  interested to  hear some expert  elucidation of that, but my question  here is in  a  different spirit.   </p>

<p>With these nonexamples out of the way, I have a very short list of examples that do meet my criteria.  </p>

<p>1)  Freyd's theorem on the nonconcretizability of the homotopy category in ""Homotopy  is  not concrete""  <a href=""http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/6/tr6abs.html"">http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/6/tr6abs.html</a>. By definition, a <em>concretization</em> of a  category is a faithful functor to the category of sets. The homotopy  category (of based  topological spaces) admits  no such functor.
The crux  of the  argument  is that  while  any object of a concretizable category has only a set's worth of generalized normal subobjects, there are objects  in the homotopy category - for example $S^2$ - which do not have this property (page  9). The original  closing remark (page 6)  mentions another nonconcretizability result, for the category of small categories and  natural equivalence classes of functors. A purist might try to disqualify the latter as too `metamathematical', but the homotopy example seems unassailable. </p>

<p>2) A  category in  which all  (co)limits exist  is said to be <em>(co)complete</em>; a <em>bicomplete</em> category is one  which is both complete  and  cocomplete. Freyd's General Adjoint  Functor  Theorem gives necessary  and  sufficient conditions for the existence of adjoints  to  a  functor $\Phi:{\mathfrak A}\rightarrow{\mathfrak B}$ with $\mathfrak  A$ (co)complete. Let us say that  a  functor which  preserves all limits  is <em>continuous</em>, and that  one which preserves all colimits is <em>cocontinuous</em>.  A <em>bicontinuous</em> functor is one which is  both continuous and  cocontinuous.</p>

<p>Let us say that  $\Phi$ is  <em>locally bounded</em>  if for every $B\in  {\rm  Ob}\,{\mathfrak  B}$ there  exists a set $\Sigma$ such that for every $A\in{\rm Ob} \,{\mathfrak A}$ and  $b\in{\rm Hom}_{\mathfrak B}(B,\Phi A)$ there exist $\hat{A}\in{\rm Ob}\,{\mathfrak A}$ and $\hat{b}\in{\rm Hom}_{\mathfrak  B}(B,\Phi\hat{A})\cap\Sigma$ such that<br>
$b=(\Phi \alpha)\hat{b}$ for some   $\alpha\in{\rm Hom}$ $_{\mathfrak A}$ $(\hat{A},A)$, and that $\Phi$  is  <em>locally cobounded</em>  if for every $B\in  {\rm  Ob}\,{\mathfrak  B}$ there  exists a set $\Sigma$ such that for every $A\in{\rm Ob}\,{\mathfrak A}$ and $b\in{\rm Hom}_{\mathfrak B}(\Phi A,B)$ there exist $\hat{A}\in{\rm Ob}\,{\mathfrak A}$ and $\hat{b}\in{\rm Hom}_{\mathfrak  B}(\Phi\hat{A},B)\cap\Sigma$ such that  $b=\hat{b}(\Phi \alpha)$ for some   $\alpha\in{\rm Hom}_{\mathfrak A}(A,\hat{A})$. In the literature these are known as the Solution Set Conditions.  </p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong>
Let $\Phi:{\mathfrak   A}\rightarrow{\mathfrak B}$ be a  functor, where $\mathfrak  B$ is locally small.  </p>

<p>$\star$ If $\mathfrak A$ is complete then $ \Phi$ admits a left adjoint if and  only if  $\Phi$ is continuous and locally bounded.<br>
$\star$ If $\mathfrak  A$ is cocomplete then $ \Phi$ admits a right adjoint if and  only if  $\Phi$ is cocontinuous and locally  cobounded.  </p>

<p>See pages  120-123 of MacLane's ""Categories for the working mathematician"".  </p>

<p>The local (co)boundedness condition has actual content. For  example:  </p>

<p>a) The  forgetful functor  ${\bf  CompleteBooleanAlgebra}\rightarrow{\bf Set}$ is continuous  but  admits  no left adjoint.  </p>

<p>b) Functors ${\bf Group}\rightarrow {\bf Set}$, continuous but  admitting no left  adjoint,  may be obtained as  follows: let $\Gamma_\alpha$   be a simple  group  of cardinality $\aleph_\alpha$ (<em>e.g.</em> the alternating group on a set of that cardinality,  or the projective special  linear group on a  2-dimensional vector space  over a field of that cardinality) and  take the   product (suitably construed), over  the  proper class  of all  ordinals, of the  functors  ${\rm  Hom}_{\bf Group}(\Gamma_\alpha,-)$.  </p>

<p>c) Freyd proposed another interesting example  (see page  -15 of the Foreword  to   ""Abelian  categories"" <a href=""http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/3/tr3abs.html"">http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/3/tr3abs.html</a>) of  a locally small bicomplete  category $\mathfrak S$ and a bicontinuous functor $\Phi:{\mathfrak S}\rightarrow {\bf Set}$ which  admits neither  adjoint: loosely speaking, the  category of  sets equipped with free  group  actions, and the evident underlying set functor. </p>

<p>Does anyone know of any other examples, especially  fundamentally  different  examples?  </p>

<p>Finally, one could focus critical attention on the very question posed. To  what extent does the strength  and  flavor of the background  set theory  matter? Force  of habit and  comfort have me  implicitly working in some material set theory such as ZF, perhaps a bit more if I want to take  advantage of Choice, perhaps a bit less if I prefer to eschew Replacement. Indeed, I have actually checked that example b)  may be formulated in the absence of  Replacement: while the von  Neumann ordinals are no longer  available, the  same trick already used to give a kosher workaround to the illegitimate product  over all ordinals further shows that an appropriate system  of local ordinals suffices for the task. I am also quite interested in  hearing what proponents  of  structural  set theory have  to say.</p>

<p>The category $\Theta$ contains $\Delta$ as the full subcategory spanned by the trees of height $1$ and is in many ways the $\omega$-categorical analogue of $\Delta$ (see <em>The petit topos of globular sets</em> by Ross Street).  </p>

<p>However, $\Delta$ is equipped with a functorial ordinal sum $[m],[n]\mapsto [m+1+n]$ arising ultimately  from the monoidal product on $\Delta_a$, the augmented simplex category.

<p>It's well-known that the category of <em>unital</em> commutative C*-algebras and $*$-homomorphisms is dual to the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps.  One finds that for all C*-algebras (with $*$-homomorphisms as morphisms) that monomorphisms are just injective maps, and epimorphisms are surjections (the latter point is non-trivial-- see the final paper which Yemon suggests in the link above).</p>

<p>Suppose instead we look at <em>locally</em> compact Hausdorff spaces, with continuous maps as morphisms.  Then dually, we get all commutative C*-algebras, but now the notion of a $*$-homomorphism is too restrictive (it corresponds to proper continuous maps).  Instead we say that a morphism between C*-algebras $A$ and $B$ is a non-degenerate $*$-homomorphism $A\rightarrow M(B)$ form $A$ to the multiplier algebra of $B$.  Such a map extends uniquely to a strictly continuous $*$-homomoprhisms $M(A)\rightarrow M(B)$, and so we can compose such maps.  Hence we get a category.  A little checking shows that the full subcategory of commutative C*-algebras, with these morphisms, is now dual to the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces with continuous maps.

So working through, a monomorphism remains just an injective map; but I see no simple description of epimorphisms (at the level of algebras-- for spaces, it's just injective continuous maps).</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Maybe this notion of ""non-degenerate"" is confusing.  If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous map between locally compact Hausdorff spaces, then we define $f_*:C_0(Y)\rightarrow C^b(X); a \mapsto a\circ f$.  Notice that we really do need the codomain to be all bounded continuous functions-- but that's okay, as $C^b(X)$ is just the multiplier algebra of $C_0(X)$, and $f_*$ turns out to be non-degenerate.  Conversely, every non-degenerate $*$-homomorphism $C_0(Y)\rightarrow C^b(X)$ arises in this way (but a general $*$-homomorphism $C_0(Y)\rightarrow C^b(X)$ can be much more complicated).</p>

Now a coalgebra of $cT$ is a couple $((A, a), a^1)$ where $(A, a)$ is a $T$-algebra and $a'$ is a $T$-algebra morphism $a': (A, a) \to  (T(A), \mu_A)$   such that $a'\circ  \epsilon_{A, a}=1 $ and $T(\eta_A)\circ a'= T(a')\circ a' $.</p>

"<p>Given a group, there is another way to define its ""(co-)homology"" using a classifying space. Specifically, one takes the partially ordered set of its proper non-trivial subgroups (if they exist), and defines the (co-)homology of the group to be the singular (co-)homology of the classifying space of the partially ordered set viewed as a small category. There are many different way to apply this method, for example, one can take the $p$-subgroups instead; or one could take the poset of subgroups which containing some particular subgroup. And there has been some known interesting results, see for example</p>

<p>Brown, K. <em>Euler characteristics of groups: the $p$-fractional part.</em> (1975)</p>

<p>Group (co-)homology obtained this way, in general is quite different from the usual ones (for discrete groups or topological groups). The classifying spaces here tend to be contractible frequently. Typically, people use this for finite groups, which sometimes provides links to homological theory of rings (see, e.g. Stanley–Reisner rings).</p>

<p>This method could be easily generalized to well-powered categories (i.e. categories whose objects have small collections of sub-objects). Yet, I always thought this is not the ""right"" kind of (co-)homology theory. </p>

<p>Is my feeling heuristically correct or wrong, or is it just some random feeling? I would also like to know if there is any interesting/useful application of this approach (other than groups).  Thanks!</p>

Quillen certainly defined these for group and used these in his above-cited article, but he never explicitly called them group (co-)homology.  Of course, everything is useful in some sense; I guess by ""not right"" I meant that they can not provide much information about the group itself. But then you'll ask me what I mean by ""much information"".... </p>

We write of course $f:A\to B$ for $\dom(f)=A,\ \cod(f)=B$ and elements of $\mathcal C'$ are also called <em>arrows</em>. <br>
We require a <em>composition</em> of consecutive arrows and <em>identity arrows</em>, satisfying  associativity and unit constraintments with coherence isomorphisms such that the coherence diagrams commute <em>up to equivalence</em>. <br>

"<p>Recall that a <em>Lie algebra</em> is a module for the operad $\mathrm{Lie}$, which is freely generated by a binary antisymmetric operation $\beta$ modulo an equation that is quadratic in $\beta$.  There is a model category on the category of dg operads over a field $\mathbb K$ of characteristic $0$, for which the weak equivalences are the homomorphisms that are isomorphisms on homology, and the fibrations are surjective homomorphisms.  See <a href=""http://math.unice.fr/~brunov/Operads.pdf"">Loday and Vallette, <em>Algebraic Operads</em></a>.</p>

<p>For this model category structure, $\mathrm{Lie}$ is not cofibrant, but it has, of course, cofibrant replacements.  One such cofibrant replacement is the operad $L_\infty$, given by Koszul duality ($\mathrm{Lie}$ is Koszul).  A short way of defining $L_\infty$ is that a module $V$ for $L_\infty$ (also called a <em>flat $L_\infty$ algebra</em>) is as follows.  Let $\operatorname s$ denote the shift operation (and I'm not going to try to figure out whether it shifts up or down), and $\operatorname{Sym}$ the symmetric algebra construction (with the usual sign rules).  Then $\operatorname{Sym}(\operatorname s V)$ is a dg Hopf algebra for any vector space $V$ (using the isomorphism $\operatorname{Sym}(X\oplus Y) \cong \operatorname{Sym}(X)\otimes \operatorname{Sym}(Y)$ and the diagonal map $X \to X\oplus X$ and functoriality).  Then an action of $L_\infty$ on $V$ is the same as a degree-$(-1)$ coderivation $\delta$ on $\operatorname{Sym}(\operatorname s V)$ that vanishes on $\operatorname{Sym}^{\leq 1}(V) = V \oplus \mathbb K$ and satisfies the Maurer–Cartan equation $(\partial + \delta)^2 = 0$.  Since any coderivation on a symmetric algebra is determined by its projection to $\operatorname{Sym}^1$, $\delta$ is the same data as a sequence of maps $\bigwedge^n V \to V$ of degree $n-2$, for $n\geq 2$.  Note that the differential $\partial +\delta$ makes $\operatorname{Sym}(\operatorname s V)$ into a dg coalgebra, but not a dg Hopf algebra.</p>

<p>If you think of $L_\infty$ as an operad, then there is a natural notion of <em>(linear) homomorphism</em> of $L_\infty$ algebras $V,W$, namely a chain complex map $V \to W$ that for each $n$ intertwines the map $\bigwedge^n V \to V$ with the map $\bigwedge^n W \to W$.  But by thinking about $L_\infty$ algebras in terms of dg coalgebras, one can also define a <em>nonlinear homomorphism</em> $V \to W$ to be any homomorphism of dg coalgebras $\operatorname{Sym}(\operatorname s V) \to \operatorname{Sym}(\operatorname s W)$.  This nonlinear notion tends to be the correct one in many parts of mathematics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong> If I didn't know about this coalgebra picture of $L_\infty$ algebras, and just had some random cofibrant replacement $\mathrm{Lie}_\infty$ of $\mathrm{Lie}$, could I have invented, say from the theory of algebraic model categories, some sort of ""nonlinear homomorphism""?  For linear homomorphisms, I believe that different models of $\mathrm{Lie}_\infty$ have Quillen-equivalent representation theories; is this still true for the nonlinear homomorphisms?</p>

"<p>In my meaning, a <strong>direct sum</strong> in a category should really be called a ""biproduct"".  If $X,Y$ are objects, then a direct sum $X \oplus Y$ is an object $Z$ along with isomorphisms $\hom(Z,A) = \hom(X,A) \times \hom(Y,A)$ and $\hom(A,Z) = \hom(A,X) \times \hom(A,Y)$ for all objects $A$.  A direct sum is unique up to canonical isomorphism if it exists, of course.  A category <strong>has (finite) direct sums</strong> if it has a zero object (an object that is both initial and terminal; i.e. ""the direct sum of zero things"") and if $X\oplus Y$ exists for any objects $X,Y$.  If a category has direct sums, then it is naturally enriched in abelian monoids.  I believe that an <strong>additive category</strong> is a category with direct sums in which all the hom-sets (which are already abelian monoids) are actually abelian <em>groups</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
Let $\mathcal C$ be any category (enriched over $\rm SET$).  Then I can make it enriched over $\rm ABGP$ by applying the $\rm Free: SET \to ABGP$ functor to each hom-set.  So now I have a new catefory ${\rm Free}(\mathcal C)$ in which I can add morphisms.  But often I want to add objects, too, so I do something like ""take the matrix category"" ${\rm Mat}(\mathcal C)$, whose objects are finite sequences of objects in $\mathcal C$ and whose morphism are matrices of morphism in ${\rm Free}(\mathcal C)$.  Then it's more or less obvious that ${\rm Mat}(\mathcal C)$ is an additive category.  If $\mathcal C$ is freely generated by some (objects and) morphisms, then ${\rm Mat}(\mathcal C)$ is presumably ""the free additive category generated by those morphisms"".</p>

<p>But often I'm not content with free additive categories.  For example, I might want to present a category by generators and relations.</p>

"<p><strong>Context:</strong> Let $\Sigma=\{U,C,A,G\}$ and $L\subset\Sigma^*$, i.e. $L$ is a language over the alphabet $\Sigma$. Let $\Sigma'=\{0,1\}$ and define a homomorphism $f:\Sigma^*\to\Sigma'^*$ by extending $U \to 00$, $C \to 01$, $A \to 10$, and $G \to 11$ in the only possible way to a homomorphism. For $L':=f(L)$ we have $L=f^{-1}(L')$, because $f$ is injective. The languages $L$ and $L'$ are nearly the same for most practical purposes. However, defining a category where they are actually isomorphic is challenging, because $f^{-1}$ is only a partial function. Nailing down the notion of a partial homomorphism between monoids seems like a reasonable first step.</p>

<hr>

<p>A homomorphism $h:M_0\to M'_0$ between two monoids with zero $M_0$ and $M'_0$ is a monoid-homomorphism between $M_0$ and $M'_0$, which maps the zero of $M_0$ to the zero of $M'_0$.</p>

<p>(1) One idea to define partial homomorphisms between two monoids $M$ and $M'$ is to adjoint zeros to $M$ and $M'$ to get monoids with zero $M_0$ and $M'_0$, and define that the partial homomorphisms between $M$ and $M'$ are the restrictions of the homomorphisms between $M_0$ and $M'_0$.</p>

<p>(2) Another idea is that a partial homomorphisms $p:M\to M'$ is a partial function $p$ which satisfies</p>

<ol>
<li>$p(1)=1'$.</li>
<li>If $p(x)=x'$ and $p(y)=y'$, then $p(xy)=x'y'$.</li>
</ol>

<p>A partial homomorphism according to (1) satisfies the conditions (2), and additionally satisfies</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>If $x\notin\operatorname{dom}(p)$ and $y\in M$, then $xy\notin\operatorname{dom}(p)$ and $yx\notin\operatorname{dom}(p)$.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conditions 1, 2, and 3 together should be equivalent to definition (1). If not, please correct me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always favored definition (1), because then a partial homomorphism would be uniquely determined by its values on a generating set. And for a <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/a/123617"">quite natural definition of partial monoids</a>, the category of partial monoids and partial homomorphisms is equivalent to the category of monoids with zero, if definition (1) is extended appropriately to partial monoids.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Context continued</strong> Sadly, $f^{-1}$ is only a partial homomorphism according to definition (2), but fails to satisfy definition (1). This is sad, because the set of partial homomorphisms from $\Sigma^*$ to $\Sigma'^*$ according to definition (1) is easy to describe. For definition (2) it is not even clear whether $\operatorname{dom}(p)$ will always be computationally enumerable, let alone having any chance to computationally enumerate the set of partial homomorphisms itself. But maybe the partial isomorphisms are better behaved, so using definition (2) could still make sense.</p>

<hr>

<p>A further test for definitions (1) and (2) is to generalize them to define when a relation $R\subset M\times M'$ is a morphism between $M$ and $M'$. Now (1) no longer makes sense, but conditions 1, 2, and 3 still make sense and become</p>

<ol>
<li>$1\ R\ 1'$.</li>
<li>If $x\ R\ x'$ and $y\ R\ y'$, then $xy\ R\ x'y'$.</li>
<li>If $x\notin\operatorname{dom}(R)$ and $y\in M$, then $xy\notin\operatorname{dom}(R)$ and $yx\notin\operatorname{dom}(R)$.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Some authors require $\operatorname{dom}(R)=M$ for relational morphisms instead of condition 3. Thus nothing is said about partial homomorphisms, and the useful asymmetry between source and target is maintained.)</p>

<p>Condition 3 feels unnatural to me in this context, because it seems unable to ensure that a morphism is uniquely determined by its behavior on a generating set. But at least $\operatorname{dom}(R)$ would still be determined by its intersection with a generating set, so even this test is not fully conclusive.</p>

<p>This is a sort of reference request. Proposition B1.3.17 in Johnstone's Elephant reads:</p>

<p><strong>Proposition 1.3.17</strong> Let $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ be categories with pullbacks, $F \colon \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{T}$ a functor having a right adjoint $R$, and $\Pi \colon \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{T}$ a fibration. Then $F^* \Pi \colon F^* \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$ satisfies any comprehension scheme satisfied by $\Pi$.</p>

I haven't found the result in Benabou's writing (unless it's in the paper in French, referenced as [101] in Johnstone, which I cannot read) nor anywhere else. Is there another version of this proof in print? Or was Johnstone the first to prove this result in this generality?</p>

<p>Furthermore, if someone patient among you actually looks at the proof, could you possibly clarify this for me: What is the notation $\mathcal{T}^{\pi_0\mathcal{D}}$ supposed to describe ($\pi_0 \mathcal{D}$ is described as the ""set of connected components of $\mathcal{D}$""? At first I suspected it was (collections of) connected diagrams in $\mathcal{T}$ - i.e. I interpreted as something like a component-wise $[\pi_0 \mathcal{D},\mathcal{T}]$ where the diagrams are sent to $\mathcal{T}$ via $\Pi$ (because of what Johnstone says right before the diagram, namely that ""applying $\Pi$ to objects and morphisms of Rect($\mathcal{D},\mathcal{C}$) yields a functor Rect($\mathcal{D},\mathcal{C}) \rightarrow \mathcal{T}^{\pi_0 \mathcal{D}}$""- but then I cannot really make sense of what he says at the last sentence of the first full paragraph of pg. 278, for which interpreting it as the $\pi_0 \mathcal{D}$-fold product of $\mathcal{T}$ makes sense.

"<p>In Awodey's Category Theory, p233 of 2nd ed. (or p205 of 1st ed.), he states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, the UMP of pullbacks essentially states that composition along
  any function α is left adjoint to pullback along α.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, what I could only prove, is that the adjunction holds in slices categories, whereas the pullback is still defined in the raw category. I wanted to find the adjunction with categories coherent with that of the pullback, but I failed.</p>

<p>Here is what I mean.</p>

<p>First, let name objects and arrows according to the figure below:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/eVsaL.jpg"" width=""250""></p>

<p>Let $\mathrm E$ be the category where objects belong.
In this category, the pullback of $\alpha$ along $h$ is $\alpha'$ and $h'$ with the universal property of pullbacks.</p>

<p>To investigate how pullback's left adjoint can be $\alpha$ composition, we should search for the natural isomorphism:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{array}{r c l}
\alpha \circ f &amp; \rightarrow &amp; h \\\\
\hline
f &amp; \rightarrow &amp; pullback(\alpha, h) \\
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>where we saw that $pullback_{\mathrm E}(\alpha,h)$ is the couple of arrows of $\mathrm E^1$ $(\alpha',h')$. But to be consistent with the fact that $f$ is a sole arrow and not a couple, we shoud see $pullback_{\mathrm E}(\alpha,h)$ as the result of applying $\alpha$-pullback operation to $h$, so this is $pullback_{\mathrm E}(\alpha)(h)=h'$.</p>

<p>But, then, $\alpha \circ f$, $h$, $f$ and $h'$ are all arrows: really, if we search for arrows between those arrows, we are not in ${\mathrm E}$ anymore, we are in some kind of arrow category. However, both the couples $(\alpha \circ f, h)$ and $(f, pullback_{\mathrm E}(\alpha)(h))$ are couples where the two arrows have the same codomain. And it suffices to take slice-category definitions of arrow. Then we have $g : \alpha \circ f \rightarrow h$ and $u : f \rightarrow h'$, that will let the natural isomorphism fulfill the definition of the universal property for pullbacks.</p>

<p>So, finally, the natural isomorphism would be meant:</p>

<p>$Hom_{Slice_{C}}(\alpha\circ f, h) \cong_{(f,h)} Hom_{Slice_{A}}(f,pullback_{\mathbf E}(\alpha)(h))$</p>

<p>Somebody could help me see why the pullback and the adjunction do not live in the same categories? Is that what Awodey meant, or is there something wrong in my understanding?</p>

"<p>Recall that when dealing with topological spaces one usually likes dealing with a subcategory of $Top$ which is <em>convenient</em>, one facet of which is that it is cartesian closed. However to get to a similar point with smooth manifolds <a href=""http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2011-363-11/S0002-9947-2011-05107-X/"">one needs to consider</a> things like diffeological spaces.

<p>More formally, an object $A$ of category $C$ with binary products is <em>exponentiable</em> if the functor $-\times A\colon C\to C$ has a right adjoint. The classification of which topological spaces are exponentiable is well known, and cartesian closed categories are defined by the fact that every object is exponentiable.</p>

<p>But in the category of (Hausdorff, finite-dimensional) smooth manifolds the only exponentiable objects are the compact manifolds of dimension at most zero. But we can still sensibly talk about smooth mapping spaces between a general compact manifold and an arbitrary manifold, where the mapping space is an object in the category of Frechet manifolds $Frech$, in which the category $Diff$ of finite-dimensional smooth manifolds sits as a full subcategory.</p>

<p>my question is related to the tensor product in k-linear additive categories.
If you have such a category, an object $A$ and a finite dimensional k-vector space $V$, then
one knows that the tensor product $V\otimes_kA$ exists.</p>

<p>One usually chooses a basis of $V$ and sets $A\otimes_kV$ simply as $A^n$ and verifies the universal property</p>

directly.</p>

<p>And if $V$ is simply $Hom(A,B)$, then you have a morphism</p>

""The Grothendieck duality theorem via Bousfield's techniques and Brown representability ""

<p>Consider the unbounded, derived category $D(M)$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ vector spaces on a compact complex manifold $M$ . I would like to show that $Rf_!$ has a right adjoint.
In order to use  Brown representability one has to show that $D(M)$ is compactly generated.
i.e. there exists a set of objects $c_i$ that commutes with direct sums:
$$Hom(c_i,\bigoplus x_j)=\bigoplus Hom(c_i,x_j)$$
and generates $D(M)$:
$$\forall c_i Hom(c_i,x)=0 \Rightarrow x=0$$</p>

My second try was shifts of
$$i_!\mathbb{Q}$$
these are generators, but again they do not seem to respect coproducts.</p>

<p>2) the injective limit with respect to the index $i$ of the projective limits with respect to the indexes $j$. Call it </p>

<p>$\injlim_i \;\;(\projlim_j\;\; (M_{i,j}))$</p>

<p>-- (Up to errors) There exists a canonical map  </p>

<p>$\displaystyle CAN : \injlim_i \;\;(\projlim_j\;\; (M_{i,j})) \;\to\; \projlim_j\;\; (\injlim_i\;\; (M_{i,j})) $</p>

<p>Under which assumptions this map is INJECTIVE ?</p>

<p>As an example if there is no arrows at all between the $M_{i,j}$, then one has a direct sum instead of the injective limit, and a product instead of a projective limit. The arrow CAN becomes</p>

<p>$\displaystyle  CAN : \oplus_i \;\;\prod_j \;M_{i,j} \;\to\; \prod_j \;\;\oplus_i \;M_{i,j}$</p>

<p>In this case the arrow CAN is always injective independently on the nature of the $M_{i,j}$ (and up to errors it is an isomorphism if and only if one of the sets of index ""$i$"" or ""$j$"" is finite). I suspect that in the general case the injectivity only depends on the nature of the arrows, but not of the nature of the objects. Does anyone have a useful comment or a reference? </p>

$$\mathcal{C}' \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C} \twoheadrightarrow \widetilde{\mathcal{C}}$$
Here, $\widetilde{\mathcal{C}}$ is the <em>modularisation</em> of $\mathcal{C}$.

"<p>The distribution of the trace of a random element of $SU_2$ is the Sato-Tate distribution.</p>

<p>The analogue of the Gaussian distribution in free probability theory is the Wigner semicircle distribution.</p>

<p>The Sato-Tate distribution and the Wigner semicircle distribution are the same.</p>

<p>Combinatorially, this comes from the fact that the moments of both those two distributions are the Catalan numbers.</p>

<p>We can categorify this as follows: If $A$ is a self-dual element of a monoidal abelian category over a field, then $Hom(1, A^{\otimes n})$ is a vector space. (By self-duality, this is also equal to $Hom(A^{\otimes a}, A^{\otimes b} )$ for any $a,b$ such that $a+b=n$.)</p>

<p>This categorifies the $n$th moment in the following way: If $G$  is a compact Lie group, and $A$ is a self-dual representation in the category of representations of $A$, then the dimension of $Hom(1, A^{\otimes n})$ is the $n$th moment of the trace of a random element of $G$ acting on $A$.  So in the case $G=SU_2$, $A$ the standard representation, the dimension is the Catalan numbers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you take a free monoidal abelian category on one self-dual generator, the moments are the Catalan numbers. (One has to take dimensions, not just over the base field, but over the ring generated over the base field by the element of $Hom(1,1)$ defined by the canonical morphism $1 \to A \otimes A \to 1$.)</p>

<p>Since the category of representations of $SU_2$ is certainly a monoidal abelian category, we have a functor from the second category to the first that sends the free generator to the standard representation.  So we have a morphism from the free moment vector spaces to the moment vector spaces of $SU_2$.</p>

<p>I believe I can show by an explicit combinatorial argument that this is an isomorphism, categorifying this identity between the two definitions of Catalan numbers.</p>

<p>Hence the free monoidal abelian category on one self-dual generator is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional representations of $SU_2$.</p>

<p><strong>First question</strong></p>

<p>I am trying to prove that <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/toddtrimble/published/Towards+a+doctrine+of+operads#concrete_description_of_cartesian_operads_16"">these</a> two functors are mutually inverses:</p>

<ol>
<li>The functor $U\colon \mathbf C\to [\mathbf{Sets}^\mathbf{Fin},\mathbf C]$ which sends $c\in\bf C$ to the functor $F\mapsto \int^nF(n)\cdot c^n$ (given two cmc categories  (see Trimble's note), we denote $[\bf C,D]$ the category of product preserving and cocontinuous functors $\bf C\to D$);</li>
<li>The functor $V\colon [\mathbf{Sets}^\mathbf{Fin},\mathbf C]\to \bf C$ which evaluates a functor $\Phi\colon \mathbf{Sets}^\mathbf{Fin}\to \mathbf C$ in $\hom(1,-)\colon \bf Fin\to Sets$.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is quite obvious that $VU(c)\cong c$ since
$$
c\stackrel{VU}{\longmapsto}\int^n \hom(1,n)\cdot c^n\stackrel{\text{Yoneda}} {\cong}c^1=c
$$
I am stuck in proving that the composition $U\circ V$ is isomorphic to ${\rm id}_{[\mathbf{Sets}^\mathbf{Fin},\mathbf C]}$: following Trimble's notations
$$
\Phi\stackrel{UV}{\longmapsto} \left(F\mapsto \int^n F(n)\cdot \Phi(\hom(1,-))^n\right)
$$
now $\int^n F(n)\cdot \Phi(\hom(1,-))^n$ can be simplified since $\Phi$ is product preserving, but I'm not able to find out why it should be equal to $\Phi(F)$.</p>

<p><strong>Second question</strong></p>

<p>Unless a mysterious duality is involved, I think that <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/toddtrimble/published/Towards+a+doctrine+of+operads#induced_monads_18"">this</a> construction gives a <em>co</em>-monad. Where am I wrong?</p>

The fact is that even if it works, I think that the aim of Trimble's note was to give an explicit definition of the functors realizing the equivalence: Instead of finding a formal reason for the equivalence to hold (which is exactly the Universal Property of PSh(C), as Martin Brandenburg said), I would rather know how to manipulate that coend in order to get $\Phi(F)$ back.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The axioms of synthetic differential geometry are intended to pin down the minimum abstract nonsense necessary for talking about the differential aspect of differential geometry using concrete objects that model infinitesimal spaces.</p>

<p>But the typical models for the axioms – the typical smooth toposes – are constructed in close analogy to the general mechanism of algebraic geometry: well-adapted models for smooth toposes use sheaves on C ∞Ring op (the opposite category of smooth algebras) where spaces in algebraic geometry (such as schemes) uses sheaves on CRing op.</p>

<p>In fact, for instance also the topos of presheaves on k−Alg op, which one may think of as being a context in which much of algebraic geometry over a field k takes place, happens to satisfy the axioms of a smooth topos (see the examples there).</p>

<p>This raises some questions.</p>

<p>Quesions:</p>

<p>To which degree do results in algebraic geometry depend on the choice of site CRing op or similar?</p>

<p>To which degree are these results valid in a much wider context of any smooth topos, or smooth topos with certain extra assumptions?</p>

<p>In the general context of structured (∞,1)-toposes and generalized schemes: how much of the usual lore depends on the choice of the (simplicial)ring-theoretic Zariski or etale (pre)geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes), how much works more generally?</p>

<p>More concretely:</p>

<p>To which degree can the notion of quasicoherent sheaf generalize from a context modeled on the site CRing to a more general context. What is, for instance, a quasicoherent sheaf on a derived smooth manifold? If at all? What on a general generalized scheme, if at all?</p>

<p>Closely related to that: David Ben-Zvi et al have developed a beautiful theory of integral transforms on derived ∞-stacks.</p>

<p>But in their construction it is always assumed that the underlying site is the (derived) algebraic one, something like simplicial rings.</p>

<p>How much of their construction actually depends on that assumption? How much of this work carries over to other choices of geometries?</p>

<p>For instance, when replacing the category of rings /affine schemes in this setup with that of smooth algebra / smooth loci, how much of the theory can be carried over?</p>

<p>It seems that the crucial and maybe only point where they use the concrete form of their underlying site is the definition of quasicoherent sheaf on a derived stack there, which uses essentially verbatim the usual definition QC(−):Spec(A)↦AMod.</p>

<p>What is that more generally? What is AMod for A a smooth algebra? (In fact I have an idea for that which I will describe on the wiki page in a moment. But would still be interested in hearing opinions.)</p>

Then a principal $G$-bundle over $M$ is a bundle $P \to M$ on which $G$ acts (by fiber-preserving maps), so that each fiber is a $G$-torsor (a $G$-action isomorphic, although not canonically so, to the action of $G$ on itself by multiplication).  A map of $G$-bundles is a bundle map that plays well with the actions.</p>

<p>Then I more-or-less know what the <em>classifying space</em> of $G$ is: it's some bundle $EG \to BG$ that's universal in the homotopy category of (principal) $G$-bundles.  I.e. any $G$-bundle $P \to M$ has a (unique up to homotopy) map $P\to EG$ and $M \to BG$, and conversely any map $M\to BG$ (up to homotopy) determines a (unique up to isomorphism) bundle $P \to M$ and by pulling back the obvious square.</p>

<p>At least this is how I think it works.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifying_space"">Wikipedia's description of $BG$ is here.</a></p>

<p>So, let $G$ be a Lie group and $M$ a smooth manifold.  On a $G$-bundle $P \to M$ I can think about <em>connections</em>.  As always, a connection should determine for each smooth path in $M$ a $G$-torsor isomorphism between the fibers over the ends of the path.  So in particular, a bundle-with-connection is a (smooth) functor from the path space of $M$ to the category of $G$-torsors.  But not all of these are connections: the value of holonomy along a path is an invariant up to ""thin homotopy"", which is essentailly homotopy that does not push away from the image of the curve.  So one could say that a bundle-with-connection is a smooth functor from the thin-homotopy-path-space.</p>

<p>More hands-on, a connection on $P \to G$ is a ${\rm Lie}(G)$-valued one-form on $P$ that is (1) invariant under the $G$ action, and (2) restricts on each fiber to the canonical ${\rm Lie}(G)$-valued one-form on $G$ that takes a tangent vector to its left-invariant field (thought of as an element of ${\rm Lie}(G)$).</p>

<p>Anyway, my question is: is there a ""space"" (of some sort) that classifies $G$-bundles over $M$ with connections?  By which I mean, the data of such a bundle should be the same (up to ...) as a map $M \to $ this space.  The category of $G$-torsors is almost right, but then the map comes not from $M$ but from its thin-homotopy path space.</p>

Then realized that this is also the aim of localising: force some arrows to become isomorphisms.</p>

<p>Here the <strong>question:</strong> is there a conceptual frame in which we can see both localisation and modding out by a relation as special cases?

<p>I suspect the answer is ""yes"" because it can be constructed along the following lines. Denote $\mathcal{Ab}$ the category of Abelian groups. For any category $\mathcal{C}$, the category $\mathcal{Hom(C, Ab)}$ is Abelian. Moreover, we have the natural functor $\mathcal{i:C \rightarrow Hom(Hom(C,Ab),Ab)}$. Thus $\mathcal{C}$ is embedded in the Abelian category $\mathcal{D:=Hom(Hom(C,Ab),Ab)}$ and we can take the Abelian category generated by $\mathcal{C}$ within $\mathcal{D}$.

<p>The opposite category of an abelian category is abelian. In particular, if $R-mod$ is the category of $R$-modules over a ring $R$ (say left modules), its opposite category is abelian.  The Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem states that this opposite category can be embedded in a category of modules over a ring $S$. This embedding is usually very noncanonical though.</p>

as an example of an abelian category which is not  a category of modules. I can't exactly tell if they mean ""it   is (for most $R$) (provably) not equivalent to a category of modules over any ring"" or ""there is no immediate structure as a module category."" If it is the former, how would one prove it?</p>

<p>I also have a variant of this question when there is additional structure on the category.</p>

<p>The module category $H-mod$ of a Hopf algebra $H$ is a tensor category.  A finite-dimensional Hopf algebra can be reconstructed   from the tensor category of finite-dimensional modules with a fiber functor  via Tannakian reconstruction.   Now $(H-mod)^{opp}$ is a tensor category as well satisfying these conditions (namely, the hom-spaces in this category are finite-dimensional).  The dual of the initial fiber functor makes sense and becomes a fiber functor from $(H-mod)^{opp} \to \mathrm{Vect}$ (since duality is a contravariant tensor functor on the category of vector spaces).  In this case, $(H-mod)^{opp}$ is the representation category of a canonical Hopf algebra $H'$.</p>

<li><p>Is there any definition of flasque sheaf in the category $O_X-mod$ only in terms of objects and morphisms(section FREE)?</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that the definition of injective object in certain category actually depends on the class of morphisms we choose.For example,in the abelian category,the standard definition of injective objects is a special case of $E$-injectives where $E$ is class of all the monomorphisms in this category.We can of course formulate some other ""non-standard"" injectives by choosing other class of morphisms. For example,in the category of commutative affine schemes,we can choose $E$ to be the class of proper monomorphisms of affine schemes such that the correspondence surjective map between two commutative rings having square zero kernel.Then the $E$-injective objects in category of commutative affine schemes is precisely the smooth affine schemes in this category.Therefore,Is it possible that the flasque sheaves are certain ""non standard"" $E$-injectives in category $O_X-mod$ with $E$ to be some class of morphisms in this category(We also notice that the class of morphisms E can be viewed as Grothendieck pretopology in this category,but maybe not finest).</p></li>

<p>If it is the case,then all the proposition of flasque sheaves can be proved purely general abstract just like injective sheaves.</p>

"<p>It is known that a quasi compact scheme(even quasi separated scheme)can be determined uniquely by the category of quasi coherent sheaves on it by Gabriel-Rosenberg reconstruction theorem</p>

<p>The elementary case will be the following statement:
If we have $R-mod\cong S-mod$(categories equivalence)for commutative ring $R,S$,then $R\cong S$.</p>

<p>However,this is not true for noncommutative ring or more general,noncommutative scheme.The counter example is provided by Morita equivalence.It is know that $R-mod\cong M_n(R)-mod$(as left modules)where $M_n(R)$ is ring of matrices with coefficient in $R$.This shows that category of left modules(considered as category of quasi coherent sheaves on ""noncommutative affine scheme"")can not uniquely determined the noncommutative ring uniquely.</p>

<p>My question is can we reconstruct noncommutative ring or noncommutative scheme(for nonaffine situation,I am not very sure what I mean,since I dont have an example in my head right now),or more precisely,taking consideration of the examples about $R-mod\cong M_n(R)-mod$,what more information do we need to uniquely determined the ring.</p>

<p>The real motivation for this question is from reconstruction of stacks.I was told by Sasha Rosenberg a couple of years ago that doing reconstruction of scheme,we just need one category,but doing reconstruction of stacks,we need two categories.(Something like fibered category or more general,category over category).It seems that the reconstruction problem for noncommutative ring is similar to that of stacks.So it seems that if we consider certain fibered category,we can do reconstruction for noncommutative scheme.What is the correct formalism to do this.There was a unpublised preprint by Sasha Rosenberg on homological algebra on fibered and cofibered category,he defined spectral of fibered category,but since its highly abstraction,I dont understand much right now </p>

<p>In Hartshorne Exercise 4.2,we have the following statement:let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a finite surjective morphism of noetherian separated scheme,with $X$ affine,then $Y$ is affine.I wonder whether one is able to formulate purely categorical argument.Let's see what Serre affiness criterion said:If $X$ is quasi compact scheme,if all higher cohomology of quasi coherent sheaves vanish,then $X$ is affine.It is known that one can argue this purely categorical as following: consider category of quasi coherent sheaves on $X$,denoted by $Qcoh(X)$,since all higher cohomology of quasi coherent sheaves vanishing,it means that $Ext^i(O_X,-)=0$ for all $i\geq 1$ which means that $O_X$ is projective generator of this category.(There is some issue here about the definition of sheaf cohomology since we usually define it in category of sheaves of $O_X$-module,but it is not a big deal since for quasi compact scheme $X$,we have adjoint functors between $Qcoh(X)$ and $O_X-mod$,then the injectives transferred,one is able to prove the statement in Exercise 3.6).Then by Gabriel-Popscue theorem,$Qcoh(X)\cong \Gamma(X,O_X)-mod$,then by reconstruction theorem,$X\cong Spec(\Gamma(X,O_X))$,then $X$ is affine.In fact,we can avoid using Gabriel-Pospcue theorem by using Beck theorem(carefully verify the condition and then establish the categories equivalence).</p>

<p>Another similar statement which can be proved categorical is the following well known statement: $f:X\rightarrow Y$ with $f$ affine and $Y$ is affine scheme,then $X$ is affine scheme,the argument is just interpreting $f$ being affine in categorical language($f_*$ has left and right adjoint and it is conservative),then use Beck's theorem and certain routine argument in category theory)</p>

<p>So,I want to formulate a categorical argument to prove Chavelly's theorem.But the problem is the following:How to characterize the surjective morphism of scheme categorically?I noticed that there was a question  <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/399892/what-is-the-definition-of-surjective-morphism-of-schemes,but"">http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/399892/what-is-the-definition-of-surjective-morphism-of-schemes,but</a> since category of schemes is not abelian category, in general,class of epimorhisms and class of surjective map(or called strict epimorphism in the sense of Kashiwara-Schapira).I am not sure what the ""surjective morphism"" in the statement of Chavelly's theorem means.""Epimorhism"" or ""strict epimorphism""?</p>

<p>It seems that there are a lot of statements like ""this scheme is affine"" ""this scheme is projective"" (to characterize the shape of scheme)can be formulated categorically by essential use of Beck's theorem.(For example, a scheme $X$ with ample line bundle is projective scheme can be proved using Beck's theorem)</p>

"<p>I suspect there is a strong connection between these two results, but I'm not able to work out the details; in particular I sense that there is a strong analogy between the SOA, stated in the following way</p>

</blockquote>

<p>To  my eye the first statement is a direct consequence of the second: the functor $R$ is no more than the idempotent monad $iR$ induced by the reflection $R\colon \mathbf E \to \Phi(\Sigma)\colon i$, and $\Sigma$-fibrant objects are defined precisely via an orthogonality condition.</p>

<p>Skimming through Garner's ""Understanding the SOA"" paper I'm not able to see a precise statement in this sense ([FK] paper is cited only at the very beginning). Maybe I'm wrong, or this interpretation of the SOA is implicitly understood? If I'm wrong in some subtle detail, can you tell me which one? If I'm not wrong, I'm interested in making this analogy precise! Can you give me references where this is stated properly?</p>

<p>2] An object $X$ is ""$\Sigma$-fibrant"" iff its terminal arrow $X\to 1$ belongs to the class $\text{rlp}(\Sigma)$ of all morphisms having the right lifting property with respect to each arrow in $\Sigma$.</p>

I can look at these constructions and see that they indeed perform the task they were made to do, but sometimes I can't see why they $\textit{should}$ perform this task; why is that the logical thing to choose for the job? Right now, I'm having this issue with the satellite of a functor.</p>

<p>I am learning about derived functors in a slightly different setting, namely with nonadditive categories where there are not necessarily enough projectives in the category $\mathcal{C}$, and so the definition is modified slightly; perhaps the definition is more transparent in the standard setting. </p>

The right adjoint of this functor is called $\mathfrak{N}$, the homotopy-coherent nerve.</p>

Form the pushout $M$ of the span $\mathfrak{C}(X^\triangleright) \leftarrow \mathfrak{C}(X)\to \mathfrak{C}(\Delta^1)\to [1]$ (the two arrows in the same direction are replaced by their composite, so this is $M=\mathfrak{C}(X^\triangleright)\coprod_{\mathfrak{C}(X)} [1]$).  </p>

"<p>Recall that the Tambara-Yamagami categories are those with fusion ring $\mathbb{Z}[A \cup m]$ where $A$ is an abelian group and $m$ is a non-invertible (simple) object such that $ma = am = m$ for all $a \in A$ and $m^2 = \sum_{a \in A} a$. </p>

<p>Tambara and Yamagami showed that the non-identity associativity isomorphisms are given by a symmetric pairing (bicharacter) $\langle, \rangle: A \times A \to \mathbb{C}^\times$ and a choice of sign for $\sqrt{|A|}$ (and, furthermore, that this data determines the category up to tensor equivalence) in [TY]. For example, the associativity isomorphism $\mathbf{a}_{a,m,b}: (a \otimes m) \otimes b \to a \otimes (m \otimes b)$ is given by $\langle a, b \rangle \mathbf{1}_m$. (Note that it is in $\mathrm{Hom}(m,m)=\mathbb{C}$.)</p>

<p>Gelaki, Naidu, and Nikshych compute the Drinfel'd center of the Tambara-Yamagami categories in section 4 of [GNN]. They give a list of the possible half-braidings for the simple objects in Proposition 4.1. It should be noted that, given the associativity isomorphisms found in [TY] for the category and properties of the half-braiding, one is able to write down commutative diagrams which give a system of linear equations with the half-braidings as unknowns that yields the [GNN] calculation (This method is less general and more computational than that in their paper; the resulting half-braidings are what is important.)</p>

<p>For example, the half-braiding $e_a(-): a \otimes (-) \to (-) \otimes a$ for an invertible object $a \in A$  is given by:</p>

<p>$e_a(b) = \langle a,b \rangle$ where $b \in A$ and the morphism is in $\mathrm{Hom}(ab,ab)=\mathbb{C}$ (recall A is abelian)</p>

<p>$e_a(m) = \epsilon$ where $\epsilon^2 = \langle a,a \rangle$</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, on the other hand, in section 3 of his second paper on the structure of sectors associated with Longo-Rehren inclusions [I2], Izumi realizes the T-Y fusion categories as systems of endomorphisms of a (weak closure of a) Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_n$ where $n=|A|$ . This happens in the following way: Let $\{S_g\}_{g\in A}$ be the generators of $\mathcal{O}_n$ and define the following endomorphisms of $\mathcal{O}_n$:</p>

<p>$a(S_g) = S_{ag}$ ($a \in A$)</p>

<p>$m(S_g) = U(g)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{|A|}}\sum_{h\in A} S_h\right)U(g)^*$</p>

<p>where $U$ is the unitary representation of $A$ in $\mathcal{O}_n$ given by $U(h)=\sum_{k\in A} \langle h, k \rangle S_kS_k^*$ (where $\langle , \rangle$ is the symmetric pairing giving  the T-Y category).</p>

<p>Clearly the unitary equivalence classes for these endomorphisms have the T-Y fusion rule (i.e. $[ma]=[am]=[m]$ and $[m^2] = \oplus_{a \in A}[a]$). The big difference here is that these categories are <em>strict</em>.</p>

<p>Izumi now also computes the center of the T-Y categories using this realization. This is where my problem arises. In the C* category language the half-braiding is given as a family of operators in $\mathcal{O}_n$ all belonging to the obvious corresponding intertwiner space, i.e. a half braiding for the object (endomorphism) $X$ of C* category $\mathcal{C}$ is given as a collection </p>

<p>$\{ E_X(Y) \in (XY,YX) : Y$ object of $\mathcal{C}\}\subseteq \mathcal{O}_n$</p>

<p>satisfying some properties. </p>

<p>Izumi computes the half-braidings for the simple objects (i.e. the group objects and $m$) in Lemma 3.2. For example, a half braiding for object $a \in A$ is given by:</p>

<p>$E_a(b) = \langle a, b \rangle \in (ab,ba)$ where $b \in A$</p>

<p>$E_a(m) = \alpha(a)U(a) \in (am,ma)$ where $\alpha: A \to \mathbb{C}^\times$ such that $\partial \alpha = \langle , \rangle$</p>

<hr>

<p>There are clear parallels in the two results here, specifically highlighted in the half-braidings for a group object offered as examples, but I am stuck when it comes to writing down a rigorous relationship between the two results. In particular, they become much more ""different"" looking when we look at the half braidings involving the non-invertible element $m$.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong>  </p>

<li><p>It seems to me that the information from the non-trivial associativities is now ""hiding out"" in the unitary representation $U(g)$ and the intertwiner spaces (e.g., $(m, ma) = \mathbb{C}U(a)$ and $(a, m^2) = \mathbb{C}S_a$); rather than having non-trivial associativities we now have non-trivial unitary equivalences, e.g. we have $ma$ is unitarily equivalent to $m$ via $U(a)$. My first attempt to understand this was to look at the intertwiner spaces corresponding to associativities, e.g. $((am)b, a(mb))$, however my calculations haven't gone anywhere (I am unfortunately quite unfamiliar with C* algebras at this point). Taking the other two basic intertwiner spaces as trivial (i.e. $(g \cdot h,gh) = \mathbb{C}$ and $(m, am) = \mathbb{C}$) can someone tell me what the aforementioned associativity intertwiner space is?  Is this even a good way to try to work out the relationship between the two results?</p></li>
<li><p>How might one begin to write down a tensor equivalence between the two ways of realizing the categories? Would this be a good way to recognize the relationship between the two computations of the half-braidings?</p></li>
<li><p>My main end goal here is to be able to take C*-categorical computations of the centers of fusion categories (such as those for other categories in Izumi's paper [I2]) and rewrite them in the more abstract language of [GNN] and [TY]. Is this something that is already known? </p></li>

Let's call an endomorphism $f : M \to M$ of an $R$-module $M$ <em>locally nilpotent</em> if for every $m \in M$ there is some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^n(m)=0$. Equivalently, for every finitely generated submodule $N \subseteq M$ there is some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $f^n |_N = 0$. In particular, for a finitely generated $M$ we don't get anything new.</p>

<p>Now consider the following category $C$: Objects are pairs $(M,f)$, consisting of an $R$-module and a locally nilpotent endomorphism $f$ of $M$. A morphism is just a commutative diagram.</p>

<p><strong>Question A.</strong> Is there a reference in the literature for the following observation: $C$ is isomorphic to the category of representations of the additive group scheme $\mathbb{G}_{a}$ over $R$.</p>

<p>This is not hard to prove. In fact, one can use the same method as in Example I.8.1 in <a href=""http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/ala.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Milne's script on algebraic groups</a>; but there $R$ is a field and $M$ is supposed to be finite dimensional, so that locally nilpotent = nilpotent.
But the same works in general, the $R[T]$-comodule structure on $M$ corresponding to $(M,f)$ is given by $M \to M[T]$, $m \mapsto \sum\limits_{n \geq 0} \frac{f^n(m) T^n}{n!}$.</p>

<p><strong>Question B.</strong> How do infinite products look like in $C$?</p>

<p>Note that the description of $C$ above shows that $C$ is cocomplete as as well as complete. The forgetful functor $C \to \mathrm{Mod}(R)$ creates colimits, so they are easy to describe. The same is true for <em>finite</em> limits, so the only limits missing are infinite products. The forgetful functor doesn't create them: For a familiy of objects $(M_i,f_i)$, the endomorphism $\prod_i f_i$ of $\prod_i M_i$ does not have to be locally nilpotent. Thus they will be more complicated.</p>

<p><strong>Question C.</strong> What are interesting examples of locally nilpotent endomorphisms which are not nilpotent?</p>

<p>Of course there are many examples: If $M$ is an $\mathbb{N}$-graded module and $f$ is of negative degree, then $f$ is locally nilpotent, but usually $f$ is not nilpotent.

I guess (but I don't have data about this) historically the recognition that ""operational"" expressions like $x^3$ or $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}$ could be formalized as functional relations led to devote more attention to functions understood in the modern set theoretical sense (i.e. as a special case of relations). That viewpoint permitted to consider things such as the Dirichlet function $\chi_{\mathbb{Q}}$ (which was previously not even considered to be a true ""function""!) as fully legitimate objects, and to not dismiss them as pathological, with great theoretical advantage.

"<p>So in Julie Bergner's work on (infty, 1)-categories <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0610239"">arXiv:0610239</a>, she considers several model categories which model (infty, 1)-categories, which are known to be equivalent. I'm guessing that there is another model which is equivalent to these. It is probably known to experts, and probably exists for easy reasons, but I'm not seeing it so I'm asking here. </p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In Julie's survey, which reviews some of her own work in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0504334"">arXiv:0504334</a>, the work of Joyal and Tierney <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0607820"">arXiv:0607820</a>, and the work of others, she compares four models of (infty, 1)-categories. They are model categories of Segal Categories, Complete Segal spaces, Quasi-categories, and Simplicial Categories. </p>

<p>All of these models are related in multiple ways, but some are more closely aligned than others. In particular the Complete Segal spaces and the Segal categories are very similar objects. The underlying categories for these two model categories are almost the same. They are the category of simplicial spaces and the category of simplicial spaces whose zeroeth space $X_0$ is discrete, respectively. </p>

<p>Among the simplicial spaces we have those which satisfy the Segal condition. These are the (Reedy fibrant) simplicial spaces such that the Segal map
$$ X_n \to X_1 \times_{X_0} \cdots \times_{X_0} X_1 $$
is a weak equivalence. These are called <em>Segal spaces</em>. There is a model structure on the category of simplicial spaces such that the Segal spaces are the fibrant objects. It is a localization of the Reedy model structure. But in this model structure the weak equivalences between Segal spaces are just the level-wise weak equivalences.</p>

<p>The model category of complete Segal spaces is a further localization of this. The weak equivalences between fibrant objects (complete Segal spaces) in this model category are pretty easy. They are the level-wise weak equivalences. More generally the weak equivalences between Segal spaces in this new model structure can also be identified, without too much trouble. They are called <em>Dwyer-Kan equivalences</em> or <em>DK-equivalences</em> for short. </p>

<p>A Segal category is a Segal space where the space of objects $X_0$ is discrete. There is a Quillen equivalent model structure on the category of those simplicial spaces whose zeroeth space is discrete. 
In this model category, a map between two Segal categories is a weak equivalence if and only if it is a DK-equivalence. </p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>I'm wondering if there is an intermediary model category which is <em>equivalent to both</em> the above model categories (hopefuly in an obvious way) which has the following properties: </p>

<ol>
<li>It should be a model category on the category of simplicial spaces.</li>
<li>The fibrant objects should be the Segal spaces. (Not necessarily complete).</li>

Let $k$ be a field of characteristic 0, let $\Vect$ be the category of vector spaces over $k$, and let $n \in \nats$ (one can get away with a commutative ring $k$ where $n!$ is invertible). Let $\Alg$ be the category of $k$-algebras, and $\CAlg$ the category of commutative $k$-algebras.</p>

<p>Consider the $n$-fold symmetric power $\Sym^n$, a nonlinear functor. This functor has a lax symmetric monoidal structure given by the map $\Sym^n V \otimes \Sym^n W \to \Sym^n(V \otimes W)$, $v_1 \cdot \dots \cdot v_n \otimes w_1 \cdot \dots \cdot w_n \mapsto \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} (v_1 \otimes w_{\sigma 1}) \cdot \dots \cdot (v_n \otimes w_{\sigma n})$ (there is something to check here -- a similar formula, with some signs thrown in, makes sense in the case of the $n$th alternating power $\wedge^n$, but in that case the requisite diagrams do not commute). As a consequence, we get functors $\Sym^n: \Alg \to \Alg$ and $\Sym^n: \CAlg \to \CAlg$. These constructions are not familiar (to me). For one thing, these algebra structures don't seem to have anything to do with the algebra structure on $\Sym(A) = \oplus_n \Sym^n(A)$ (which ignores the multiplication on $A$).</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> If $A$ is an algebra, what is this algebra structure on $\Sym^n(A)$ called, and where can I find out more about it?</p>

<p><strong>An analogous, simpler construction:</strong> The lax symmetric monoidal structure on $\Sym^n$ descends from a lax symmetric monoidal structure on the $n$th tensor power functor $T^n: \Vect \to \Vect$, $V \mapsto V^{\otimes n}$, where the lax monoidal structure is $T^n V \otimes T^n W \to T^n(V \otimes W)$, $v_1 \otimes \dots \otimes v_n \otimes w_1 \otimes \dots \otimes w_n \mapsto v_1 \otimes w_1 \otimes \dots \otimes v_n \otimes w_n$. So if $A$ is a $k$-algebra, $T^n A$ is a $k$-algebra, with ""component-wise"" multiplication $(a_1 \otimes a_2)(a_3 \otimes a_4) = a_1 a_3 \otimes a_2 a_4$, and so we have a functor $T^n : \Alg \to \Alg$ which restricts to $T^n: \CAlg \to \CAlg$. This functor is not very mysterious: $\Hom_\Alg(T^n A, B)$ is just $n$ commutating algebra homomorphisms $A \to B$, and in particular, $T^n$ is just the $n$-fold coproduct on commutative algebras.</p>

<p><strong>The case $n=2$:</strong> Let's look at $\Sym^2(A)$, and assume for simplicity that $A$ is commutative. This algebra has multiplication $(a_1 \cdot a_2)(a_3 \cdot a_4) = \frac{1}{2} \left( a_1 a_3 \cdot a_2 a_4 + a_1 a_4 \cdot a_2 a_3\right)$ (I'm using ""$\cdot$"" to denote the symmetric tensor and juxtaposition to denote multiplication in $A$ or in $\Sym^2(A)$). This algebra is generated additively by the square elements by the usual polarization identity $a_1 \cdot a_2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( (a_1 + a_2)\cdot (a_1 + a_2) - a_1 \cdot a_1 - a_2\cdot a_2 \right)$. So we get a natural embedding $\Hom_\Alg(\Sym^2(A),B) \hookrightarrow \Hom_{\mathrm{Monoid}}(A, B)$ (where $A$ and $B$ are considered as multiplicative monoids) via $\phi \mapsto f$, where $f(a) := \phi(a \cdot a)$. We can characterize the image of this embedding and thus the functor corepresented by $\Sym^2(A)$: I believe that algebra homomorphisms $\phi: \Sym^2(A) \to B$ correspond to monoid homomorphisms $f: A \to B$ such that</p>

"<p>Let $\mathcal C$ denote an abelian category.  Consider a formal $\mathbb Z$-graded object $V_\bullet$ in $\mathcal C$, by which I simply mean a $\mathbb Z$-indexed list $n\mapsto V_n$ of objects.  A <em>differential</em> on $V_\bullet$ is a sequence of maps $\partial : V_n \to V_{n-1}$ such that $\partial^2 = 0$; for example, the sequence of all $0$s works.  A differential is <em>exact</em> if for every $n$, $\ker \partial|_{V_n} = \partial(V_{n+1})$.
Clearly, for fixed $V_\bullet \in \mathcal C$, the collection of differentials is the intersection of some quadrics in some abelian group.  I have less of an idea of what type of space the exact differentials constitute, which is one of the motivations for my question.</p>

<p>Thus, fix a $\mathbb Z$-graded object $V_\bullet \in \mathcal C$.  Suppose that you fix also an exact differential $\partial_0$.  There are many situations where one is interested in ""varying"" $\partial_0$ to some new differential $\partial$.  One situation that arises is the ""formal deformation"": we can formally extend $\mathcal C$ to a new category $\mathcal C[\![\hbar]\!]$ by tensoring every hom set with $\mathbb Z[\![\hbar]\!]$, and then consider differentials $\partial$ on $V_\bullet[\![\hbar]\!]$ such that $\partial = \partial_0 \mod\hbar$.  I can also imagine more algebrogeometric contexts: I expect that there is a natural way to give the hom spaces in an abelian category, and thus the space of differentials, the structure of affine algebraic varieties; then I could probe this space by, say, local Artinian rings.  I could also, of course, probe non-infinitesimal neighborhoods.</p>

<p>In any case, one should expect that if $\partial_0$ is exact that $\partial$ is ""close enough"" to $\partial_0$, then $\partial$ is also exact.  I know how to prove a special case of this.  Say that $\mathcal C$ <em>has the Axiom of Choice</em> if every epimorphism in $\mathcal C$ splits.  Then, since $\mathcal C$ is abelian, it must also have the Axiom of ""co-Choice"", and one can always choose a deformation retraction of any complex onto its homology, for example, and also one can always choose an isomorphism between a (Hausdorff exhaustive) filtered object and its associated graded.  Under these conditions, I can prove that formal deformations of exact differentials remain exact.  Another somewhat trivial example is when $V_\bullet = (V_0,V_1)$ is two terms long.  Then an exact differential is an isomorphism $\partial_0 : V_1 \overset\sim\to V_0$.  Consider the situation when $\mathcal C$ is, say, the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces.  Then the space of isomorphisms is naturally a Zariski-open (and hence analytically open, if we are over $\mathbb R$) subset of the space of all maps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong>  Is there a way to give the the space of differentials on $V_\bullet$ a natural (Zariski, say, but I'm agnostic) topology, perhaps under some conditions on $\mathcal C$, and if so, how?  Under what conditions does the slogan ""exactness is an open condition"" hold?  As a special case, does it hold for ""infinitesimal"" (either in the local-Artinian or $\hbar$ sense) deformations in the absence of Choice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A further version of my question recognizes the fact that many categories are naturally enriched in topological abelian groups; categories of Banach spaces, for example.  Then one can also ask: when is exactness an open condition for ""analytic"" topologies?</p>

<p>Lest you say that exactness is <em>always</em> an open condition, let me end with a trivial parting comment.  I could, if I so chose, give every space the indiscrete topology.  For this topology, exactness certainly is not open, as deforming all the way to $\partial = 0$ would be a ""small"" deformation.</p>

which makes {$\varinjlim_{i}A_{i}^{r}, f^{sr}$} a direct system.</p>

"<p>Disclaimer: I know practically nothing about category theory, so sorry if the answer is ""obvious"".</p>

<p>Consider a category C, a subcategory D and a ""closure"" (i.e. idempotent) functor F : C &rarr; D. Then, given an object X &isin; D, what is the ""smallest"" Y &isin; C such that F(Y) = X?</p>

<p>It's not clear that ""smallest"" is well-defined for all such categories and idempotent functors, but here are two motivational examples from algebra where the categories are concrete (so objects can be ordered by isomorphic inclusion) and the functors are a form of set extension:</p>

<p>C the category of fields, D the category of algebraically closed fields, F algebraic closure.</p>

<p>C the category of (integral) domains, D the category of fields, F ""field of fractions"".</p>

<p>Here I would like to ask about some important thing which I do not understand clearly. </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Is it necessary for theory to have given interpretation in some
universe by definition or not, it is not necessary for set of axiom to be a theory?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The meaning of question above is: is this a <strong>correct</strong> way of defining theory if we do not give domain of interpretation for it? What obstacles may arise from that? <strong>For example</strong>: As far as I know standard category theory do not qualify clearly which is its domain of interpretation, then, may we say that it is ""defined theory"" from a formal point of view? I have heard that there are some efforts to define category theory by means of metacategories which probably has as one of its aims to give clear definition of domain of interpretation. </p>

<p>So there another question arises for which I will try to give some introduction by example.</p>

<p>I may think about theory which when interpreted in set universe defined by some formulas, relations whatever may be consistent and have models, whilst in other universes do not. Is this a case? For example in answer about possible definition of domain of discourse for first order theories <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/15812/theory-interpreted-in-non-set-domain-of-discourse-may-be-consistent/15813#15813"">here</a> Joel David Hamkins wrote: ""If V is the universe of all sets, we can define certain classes in V, such as { x | φ(x) }, where φ is any property."" </p>

<p>What if $\phi(x)$ is not property from first order logic? </p>

<p>For example we may consider sentence $S= \{x | \phi (x) \}$ as meaning:""for every theory x when schema of axioms of induction is present in axiom set"". It is clearly not first order sequence, so maybe model which is interpreted in such universe is not first order model even if axiom of theory forms first order set? The only difference here is in a way we introduce a domain of interpretation so maybe this level of freedom is too much? </p>

<p>Usual definition of domain of interpretation which I have found in wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_%2528mathematical_logic%2529"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> uses set ""structure"" but not state clearly that domain of discourse has to be first order set from the beginning! It is something which is not clear for me here. Should I believe that some ""interpretations"" of theory may be inconsistent whilst other may be consistent when we drop interpretation part as a definition and we leave it free?</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>If we construct theory in first order logic ( for example as in my <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/15812/theory-interpreted-in-non-set-domain-of-discourse-may-be-consistent"">second question</a>), and then we will try to use it on domain of objects defined by means of higher order logic, do we end with higher order theory, or rather first order theory which is saying something about second order logic objects?</strong> Or maybe the answer is"" ""it depends"" and there should be stated additional requirements?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have hope it is no obviously wrong question...</p>

<p><strong>Note 1.</strong>  As I do not want to be found very speculative, I will point to blog of Terence Tao <a href=""http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/08/27/printer-friendly-css-and-nonfirstorderizability/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> where You may find some information about nonfirstorderisability and specially this sentence:</p>

  <p>which is part of the fundamental

<p><strong>Note 2.</strong> In wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse-Kelley_set_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> I found the following remark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""MK can be confused with second-order
  ZFC, ZFC with second-order logic
  (representing second-order objects in

  its background logic. The language of

  MK (although a set and a class having
  the same extension can no longer be
  identified), and their syntactical
  resources for practical proof are
  almost identical (and are identical if
  MK includes the strong form of
  Limitation of Size). But the semantics
  of second-order ZFC are quite
  different from those of MK. For

<p>If we consider a pseudo-monoid in the  monoidal 2-category $Cat$ (with cartesian monoidal structure) we get a usual (small) monoidal category, and by G. Kelly theorems all diagrams of canonical isomorphisms are commutative, but this is like saying that all the (two dimensional) diagram built by canonical 2-cells are commutative (or coherent).</p>

<p><strong>I ask</strong>: Is this true in general? Are all the cell diagrams of a pseudomponoids (built using only the canonical $\alpha, \rho, \lambda$ the tensor composition, and the canonical isomorphisms of $\mathcal{C}$) coherent?</p>

<p>I just know that a pseudo-monoid is a particular tricategory (with the theorem of triequivalence to a Gray-enriched category), but in this full-generality we have only a ""weak coherence"" (no all diagrams commute).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:
Edit: Given a diagram of canonical cells on $\mathcal{C}$ one could think to use some ""kind of Yoneda lemma"" for traslate the question on $Cat$, the fault is that  $[-, X]: \mathcal{C}^{op}\to Cat$  don't preserve (neither has a some kind of correlation to) the monoidal product $\otimes$. But if $X$ is a $\otimes$-monoid then<br>
$[-, X]: \mathcal{C}^{op}\to Cat$ is a monoidal functors </p>

<p>(from the morphisms-dual (the some monoidal product) of $\mathscr{C}$ to the monoidal cartesian structure of $Cat$)  </p>

<p>and if applied on a  pseudo-monoid of $\mathcal{C}$ maps it in a pseudo-monoid of $Cat$ (diagrams (MF1), (MF2), (MF3) p. 473 of Kelly, Eilenberg ""Closed CAtegories"", then if applied to a cells diagrams (relative to a pseudo-monoid) we get a similar diagram (relative to  pseudo-monoid image)</p>

<p>(the some if $X$ is a comonoid and consider $[X,-]: \mathcal{C} \to Cat$, if $X$ is a pseudo-monoid $[-, X]$ is a pseudo.monoidal functors i.e. the diagrams  (MF1), (MF2), (MF3) commuting but 2-isomorphisms).</p>

<p>Now the functors  $[X, -]$ ($X\in \mathcal{C}$ simply) are useful because they are collectively faithful (locally too) (then if their images is ever a coherent diagram the initial diagram is coherent), but in our situation we have to use only monoids $X$ (no simple objects).</p>

<p><strong>Then the second question</strong> is: Has a monoidal 2-category $\mathcal{C}$ enough-monoids (i.e. the family of $[-, X]$ for $X$ monoid, is (locally) faithful) ? </p>

<p>If we  request $\mathcal{C}$ representable as 2-category (i.e. with comma objects) has it enough-monoids?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>I did this partial answer (enough for many results):</p>

<p>Given a 2-category $\mathscr{A}$ and a object  $G \in  C$ we define the category  $\mathscr{A} \searrow G$ with object of type $(A, a)$, $a: A \to  G$ and morphisms of type $(f, \phi ): (A, a) \to  (B, b)$, $f: A \to  B$, $\phi : a \Rightarrow  b \circ f$ and natural composition and unities. Let $(G, \alpha, \lambda , \rho, m, e)$ a pseudomonoid of a monoidal 2-category $\mathscr{C}$, and consider the full subcategory $ \widetilde{G} \subset  \mathscr{C} \searrow G$ where objets are defined by induction as:</p>

<p>1) $(I, e)$ and $(G, 1_G)$ are object of  $\widetilde{G}$.</p>

<p>2) if $(X, x), (Y, y)$ are object of  $\widetilde{G}$ then so is also  their monoidal product $(X, x) \otimes  (Y, y)$ defined as
$(X \otimes Y, m\circ (x \otimes   y))$.</p>

<p>Now $\widetilde{G}$ has a monoidal structure, with $(I, e)$ as unity object, monoidal product defined as above, with canonical isomorphism defined by induction using the elements $\alpha, \lambda , \rho, m,  e$  (I seems that work, it is tedious but no hard).</p>

<p>Then we have a partial results: <em>all diagram of cells (having a final vertex $G$ corresponding to canonical diagrams of $\widetilde{G}$) are coherent.</em></p>

<p>If we suppose that $\mathscr{C}$  has a symmetry, can generalize a bit because  a monoidal product of copies of $G$ or $I$ become the monoidal product of the pseudo.monoids $G$ or $I$, and a reasoning similar to above (make a new induction building, that start from a  object already built with the prior induction) concludes the proof.  </p>

"<p>Bénabou introduced the notion of profunctor quite some time ago advocating that they would be some sort of categorical flavoured relations (or at least that is what I understand of the story). An ivertible morphism in $\cal Rel$ being just a bijection between sets, I was wondering if such analogy still holds in the case of profunctors. Indeed, if $F : {\cal A} \times {\cal B}^{op} \to {\cal Set}$ is an invertible profunctor with inverse $G : {\cal B} \times {\cal A}^{op} \to {\cal Set}$ then $$\forall a_1, a_2 \in {\cal A}, (G \circ F)(a_1, a_2) \cong {\cal A}(a_1, a_2)$$ and $$\forall b_1, b_2 \in {\cal B}, (F \circ G)(b_1, b_2) \cong {\cal B}(b_1, b_2)$$ As composition of profunctors can be seen as an appropriate quotient of a coproduct, we can extract that for any $a : a_1 \to a_2$ there exists some $b \in {\cal B}, x \in F(a_2, b)$ and $y \in G(b, a_1)$ such that the equivalence class of $(x, y)$ correspond to $a$. Of course we also have the same thing exchanging the positions of the categories $\cal A$ and $\cal B$. </p>

<p>edit : The end of my post did not make any sense so I have corrected it. </p>

<p>In the case where both profunctors $F$ and $G$ happens to be representable, let's say $F = {\cal B}(-, F^0 -)$ and $G = {\cal A}(-, G^0 -)$ for $F^0 : {\cal A \to B}, G^0 : \cal B \to A$, then we can show that 
$$ \forall a_1, a_2 \in {\cal A}, {\cal A}(a_1, G^0F^0(a_2)) \cong (G \circ F)(a_2, a_1) \cong {\cal A}(a_1, a_2) $$ 
and also 
$$ \forall b_1, b_2 \in {\cal B}, {\cal B}(b_1, F^0G^0(b_2)) \cong (F \circ G)(b_2, b_1) \cong {\cal B}(b_1, b_2) $$</p>

I think the oplax (co)limit are the dependent sum/product pushed across a Yoneda-like transformation (though I'm not entirely sure that it's Yoneda).  Coq's dependent sum and product are more similar to the oplax (co)limit formulation, and while nCatLab has good pages on <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+sum"" rel=""nofollow"">dependent sum</a> and <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+product"" rel=""nofollow"">dependent product</a>, it doesn't seem to have such a page on oplax limits.</p>

"<p>Let me add one more edit to help explain why this is a serious question. Theorem 5 below is a sort of lattice version of Urysohn's lemma, and <em>it has essentially the same proof</em>. Theorem 6, the famous theorem of Raney characterizing completely distributive lattices, is an easy consequence of this result. In other words, a result of basic importance in lattice theory is somehow at heart ""the same"" as Urysohn's lemma. But ""the same"" in what sense?</p>

<hr>

<p>I noticed this weird analogy a long time ago. Is there a good explanation?</p>

<p>A <em>lattice</em> is a partially ordered set in which every pair of elements has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. Now let me set up some very nonstandard terminology which will show what I am talking about. Say that a lattice is <em>compact</em> if every subset has a least upper bound (join) and a greatest lower bound (meet). A map between lattices is <em>continuous</em> if it preserves arbitrary (i.e., possibly infinite) joins and meets whenever these exist in the domain. A subset $C$ of a lattice is <em>closed</em> if $$x \in C,\,x \leq y \quad\Rightarrow\quad y \in C$$ and $C$ is stable under the formation of arbitrary meets whenever these exist. A subset $U$ is <em>open</em> if $x \in U,\,x \leq y \,\Rightarrow \,y \in U$ and the complement of $U$ is stable under the formation of arbitrary joins whenever these exist. A subset is <em>clopen</em> if it is both closed and open. A lattice is <em>totally disconnected</em> if for every $x \not\leq y$ there is a clopen subset containing $x$ but not $y$. A lattice is <em>Hausdorff</em> if for every $x \not\leq y$ there exist a closed set $C$ and an open set $U$ whose union is the whole space and such that $x \in U$, $y \not\in C$.</p>

<p>Note that ""closed"" and ""open"" do not refer to any topology. For instance, the union of two closed sets need not be closed. I am aware that every poset carries a natural topology, but that does not seem particularly relevant here.</p>

<p>Now here are some theorems.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 1.</strong> Any union of open sets is open, and any intersection of closed sets is closed.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 2.</strong> A map between two spaces is continuous if and only if the inverse image of any closed subset is closed and the inverse image of any open set is open.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 3.</strong> Any continuous image of a compact space is compact.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 4.</strong> A space is totally disconnected if and only if it embeds in a power of the two-element space.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 5.</strong> If a space is compact Hausdorff and $x \not\leq y$ then there is a continuous map into $[0,1]$ taking $x$ to $1$ and $y$ to $0$.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 6.</strong> Every compact Hausdorff space embeds in a power of $[0,1]$.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 7.</strong> Every compact Hausdorff space is the continuous image of a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space.</p>

<p>(In the usual terminology, a ""compact Hausdorff"" lattice is a completely distributive complete lattice.)</p>

<p>Each of these statements is true both of topological spaces (replacing $x \not\leq y$ with $x \neq y$ in Theorem 5) and, with my terminology, also of lattices. I am not sure what form a satisfying explanation would take. Is there a broader theory of which topological spaces and lattices are both special cases? Is there some other way of understanding this? Or is it not as remarkable as it seems, and needs no special explanation.</p>

<p>(I'm including a category theory tag because I suspect that may be an arena in which an explanation could be found.)</p>

<p>Edit: I'm getting some feedback (Wallman's generalization of Stone duality, Scott continuity) describing other, as far as I can tell unrelated, connections between lattice theory and topology. Obviously that's not what I'm asking for.</p>

<p>Maybe I should emphasize that Theorem 6 is a serious result about completely distributive lattices, discovered in 1952 by G. N. Raney. From my point of view it is rather easy ... if anyone can show me how to get it out of Wallman's theory, I will retract the preceding comment.</p>

<p>If my mind is correct, Segals delooping machine gives a functor $Sp$ from topological symmetric monoidal categories $C$ to prespectra (In this question, a presepectrum is a sequence of based spaces $X_0,X_1$,... with structure maps $\Sigma X_i\rightarrow X_{i+1}$) with $Sp(C)_0=BC$ the classifying space of the category. </p>

<p>If I remember correctly, one of Segals results is that the adjoints of the structure maps $Sp(C)_i\rightarrow \Omega Sp(C)_{i+1}$ are weak homotopy equivalences for $i\ge1$ and for $i=1$ this is the case iff $\pi_0(Sp(C)_0)=\pi_0(BC)$ is an abelian group with the induced multiplication which comes from the fact that $BC$ is a commutative monoid up to homotopy.</p>

<p>As explained in Jacob Lurie's <a href=""http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/papers/cobordism.pdf"">paper</a> on the cobordism hypothesis, we have an action of O(2) on the $\infty $-groupoid $X$ given by considering fully dualizable objects and invertable morphisms in some symmetric monoidal $(\infty ,2)$ category $\mathcal C$. I am interested in the case when $\mathcal C$ is the category where objects are algebras, 1-cells are bimodules, 2-cells maps of bimodules etc... By an algebra, I want to include algebra objects in some $\infty$-category (e.g. chain complexes), so that $\mathcal C$ really has non-trivial 3-cells, 4-cells and so on.</p>

<p>Now, I know (from remark 4.2.7) that the fixed points for the induced action of SO(2) on this space correspond to cyclic Frobenius algebras, i.e. smooth, proper algebras $A$, with a non-degenerate <em>and $SO(2)$-equivariant</em> trace</p>

<p>$A \otimes _{A^e} A \to k$.</p>

<p>Here, non-degenerate means that the pairing $A\otimes A \to A\otimes _{A^e} A \to k$ is nondegenerate. Recall also that the Hochschild homology $A \otimes _{A^e} A$ carries and $SO(2)$ action, so it makes sense to talk about $SO(2)$-equivariant map above. </p>

<p>The data of SO(2) equivariance should be equivalent to descending the trace to cyclic homology.</p>

<p>However, the reason why the fixed points are as above is that both can be identified with 2-d  oriented TFTs, after theorem 3.1.8 which describes how to extend from a (n-1)-dimensional TFT to an n-dimensional one.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Can we calculate this action and identify the fixed point space directly?</strong></p>

<p>Part of this is not too hard to see (I think): naively, the SO(2) action on $X$ gives a canonical (Morita) automorphism of each (f.d.) algebra $A$. This automorphism is given by the bimodule dual $A^!$ (or the other one $A^\vee$...), so being a fixed point means to give an isomorphism $A^! \to A$, which is the same as a non-degenerate map $A\otimes _{A^e} A \to k$. If the base category where our algebra lives has no higher structure, then I think this is enough, but this does not explain the $SO(2)$ equivariance.</p>

<p><strong>In particular, where does the SO(2)-equivariance data come from?</strong></p>

<p>To see this, I tried to go a little deeper (with help from Takuo Matsuoka): the action is given by a map $B\mathbb Z =SO(2) \to Aut(X)$, which we transformed into a map $\mathbb Z \to \Omega Aut(X)$. The data described above corresponds to picking an algebra $A$ and composing to get a map $\mathbb Z \to \Omega X$ = Invertable $A-A$-bimodules. However, we  haven't used that the original map from SO(2) is a group homomorphism - this should correspond to the map $\mathbb Z \to \Omega Aut(X)$ being an $E_2$-map. So we get braiding data attached to each of the $A^!$, which should be trivialized (because the E_2 -structure on $\mathbb Z$ is trivial (?)). Then to give a fixed point we must take into account all this data...</p>

<p>One naive approach would fail: We could just take the smooth cobordism category, which has as $n$-morphisms $n$-manifolds embedded into $\mathbb{R}^\infty \times \mathbb{R}^n$ (such that the projections onto the last $n$ components are Morse functions) together with $n$ tuples $(t^i_1 , \ldots t^i_{k_i}), i \in \{1\ldots n\}$ such that the projections are regular on the $t^i_j$. (I'm leaving out tons of details about the topology and the simplicial structure, but I think they aren't important here.) Now we would want to demand that the manifold be triangulated such that the preimages of the projections on the $t^i_j$ lie in the $(n-1)$-skeleton of the triangulation to assure that composition happens along triangulated $(n-1)$-manifolds.</p>

<p>But this is the wrong definition: If we think about e.g. 2d ETQFTs, we could assign a vector space $V$ to the interval and want a triangle with a certain orientation to be mapped to a morphism $V \otimes V \to V$, e.g. a multiplication. But this would mean that the two source edges and the target edge would share two points. Thus, there is no embedding such that the source edges lie in the preimage of a $t_0$ and the target edge lies in the preimage of a $t_1$ since there is a distance between the hyperplanes defined by the $t_i$.</p>

"<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Let us call an object of an additive category sumpact (contraction of ""sums"" and ""compact"") if taking $Hom$ from it (considered as functor from the category to $Ab$) commutes with coproducts. Note that to be sumpact is weaker than to be compact (which means that $Hom$ from you commutes with filtered colimits).</p>

<p>Let us take, for our additive category, the category of left modules over some ring. It is known that compact objects in this category are exactly the finitely presented objects. What about sumpact objects?</p>

<p>It is clear that every finitely generated module is sumpact. When I try to prove the converse, I get into some pathological things.</p>

<p>Say, if a module has an increasing $\mathbb{N}$-sequence of submodules whose union is the whole module, and such that the union of every finite subsequence is not the whole module, then it is clear that this module is not a sumpact object (by considering the morphism from it to the direct sum of the quotients by members of our sequence). But it seems not clear (perhaps not true) that every non finitely generated module has such a sequence.</p>

<p>Also, when I check in the internet, it seems people put some condition: the ring is assumed to be perfect. Then indeed sumpact = f.g.</p>

<p>So my question is: for a general ring it is not true that sumpact implies f.g.? Can you give an example? Can you give an example when the ring is commutative? Can you indicate what perfect means and why then everything is OK?</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>It may help to see a previous question I asked <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/13581/quantum-channels-as-categories-question-1"">about quantum channels</a> in order to understand the basis for this question.</p>

<p>A quantum channel is a mapping between algebras of bounded linear operators on Hilbert spaces, $\Phi : L(\mathcal{H}_{A}) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{B})$, where $L(\mathcal{H}_{i})$ is the family of operators on $\mathcal{H}_{i}$.  In general, we are interested in completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) maps.  The operator spaces can be interpreted as $C^{*}$-algebras (with the involution being the standard Hilbert space adjoint, denoted by $\dagger$) and thus we can also view the channel as a mapping between $C^{*}$-algebras, $\Phi : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$.  Since quantum channels can carry classical information as well, we could write such a combination as $\Phi : L(\mathcal{H}_{A}) \otimes C(X) \to L(\mathcal{H}_{B})$ where $C(X)$ is the space of continuous functions on some set $X$ and is also a $C^{*}$-algebra.  In other words, whether or not classical information is processed by the channel, it (the channel) is a mapping between $C^{*}$-algebras.  Note, however, that these are not necessarily the same $C^{*}$-algebras.  Since the channels are represented by square matrices, the input and output $C^{*}$-algebras must have the same dimension, $d$ (i.e. physicists will often ""cheat"" and refer to the dimension of an $n\times n$ matrix as simply $n$).  Thus we can consider them both subsets of some $d$-dimensional $C^{*}$-algebra, $\mathcal{C}$, i.e. $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{C}$. Thus a quantum channel is a mapping from $\mathcal{C}$ to itself.</p>

<p>A quantum channel may be written as a Kraus decomposition,</p>

<p>$T(\rho) = \sum_{i}A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger}$</p>

<p>where the $\left\{A_{i}\right\}$ are the Kraus operators (and square matrices) and where</p>

<p>$\sum_{i}A_{i}^{\dagger}A_{i}=\textbf{1}$</p>

<p>and $T(\textbf{1})=\textbf{1}$.</p>

<p>Suppose we have two quantum channels, $r$ and $t$</p>

<p>$\begin{eqnarray*}
r: \rho \to \sigma &amp;
\qquad \textrm{where} \qquad &amp;
\sigma=\sum_{i}A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger} \\
t: \sigma \to \tau &amp;
\qquad \textrm{where} \qquad &amp;
\tau=\sum_{j}B_{j}\sigma B_{j}^{\dagger} 
\end{eqnarray*}$</p>

<p>where the $\left\{A_{i}\right\}$ and $\left\{B_{i}\right\}$ are the Kraus operators for the channels respectively.  We form the composite $t \circ r: \rho \to \tau$ where</p>

<p>$\begin{align}
\tau &amp; = \sum_{j}B_{j}\left(\sum_{i}A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger}\right)B_{j}^{\dagger} \notag \\
&amp; = \sum_{i,j}B_{j}A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger}B_{j}^{\dagger} \\
&amp; = \sum_{k}C_{k}\rho C_{k}^{\dagger} \notag
\end{align}$</p>

<p>where $i \cdot j = k$.  Since $A$ and $B$ are summed over separate indices the trace-preserving property is maintained, i.e. $\sum_{k} C_{k}^{\dagger}C_{k}=\textbf{1}$.</p>

<p><strong>Core argument</strong></p>

<p>From above, we note that</p>

<p>$\tau=\sum_{i,j}B_{j}A_{i}\rho A_{i}^{\dagger}B_{j}^{\dagger}$.</p>

<p>Suppose we only have two Kraus operators for each, i.e. $A_{1}, A_{2}, B_{1}, B_{2}$.  Then</p>

<p>$\tau=B_{1}A_{1}\rho A_{1}^{\dagger}B_{1}^{\dagger} + B_{2}A_{1}\rho A_{1}^{\dagger}B_{2}^{\dagger} + B_{1}A_{2}\rho A_{2}^{\dagger}B_{1}^{\dagger} + B_{2}A_{2}\rho A_{2}^{\dagger}B_{2}^{\dagger}$.</p>

<p>($\tau$ of course has a matrix representation (in fact it is a square matrix representation).  The following has nothing to do with the size of the matrix representation of $\tau$ and only has to do with the terms in the above summation.)</p>

<p>Using the subscripts as a guide, I can make a matrix</p>

<p>$\begin{equation*}
\left(
\begin{array}{c c}
B_{1}A_{1}\rho A_{1}^{\dagger}B_{1}^{\dagger} &amp; B_{1}A_{2}\rho A_{2}^{\dagger}B_{1}^{\dagger} \\[8pt]
B_{2}A_{1}\rho A_{1}^{\dagger}B_{2}^{\dagger} &amp; B_{2}A_{2}\rho A_{2}^{\dagger}B_{2}^{\dagger} \\[8pt]
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation*}$</p>

<p>This just happens to be the same dimension as the matrix representation of $\sigma \otimes \rho$.  If I then do repeated composition I get,</p>

<p>$\begin{equation*}
\left(
\begin{array}{c c c}
B_{1}A_{1}\rho A_{1}^{\dagger}B_{1}^{\dagger} &amp; B_{1}A_{2}\rho A_{2}^{\dagger}B_{1}^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots \\[8pt]
B_{2}A_{1}\rho A_{1}^{\dagger}B_{2}^{\dagger} &amp; B_{2}A_{2}\rho A_{2}^{\dagger}B_{2}^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots \\[8pt]
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation*}$</p>

<p>The next step is simply to clarify the purpose.  Suppose now that I take the output of a quantum channel and feed it back in on itself.  In this case, $\left\{A_{i}\right\}=\left\{B_{i}\right\}$.  Thus if we repeatedly apply the same channel $n$ times,</p>

<p>$\begin{equation}
T(\rho) \circ T(\rho) \circ \cdots \circ T(\rho) = \sum_{i^{n}}(A_{i})^{n}\rho (A_{i}^{\dagger})^{n}
\end{equation}$</p>

<p>we can take the terms of this expansion, form a matrix out of it, and that matrix (which may or may not have any physical significance) turns out to have the same dimension as the matrix representation of,</p>

<p>$T(\rho) \otimes T(\rho) \otimes \cdots \otimes T(\rho) = \bigotimes^{n}_{i=1} T(\rho)$.</p>

<p>Physically, the last equation is like applying $n$ copies of a channel simultaneously.  In other words, there may be some kind of strange physical link between applying $n$ copies of a channel <em>simultaneously</em> and applying them in succession.</p>

"<p>We can show that the category of profinite algebras, cofiltered limits of finite algebras, is monadic over Stone spaces as follows. So, I wonder if there are any other examples.</p>

<p>In case that I was mistaken, a proof is sketched as follows. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Proposition</strong>. Let $A$ be an algebraic theory and $\mathbf{StoneA}$
  the category of topological $A$-algebras with continuous homomorphisms.
  Then, the category of profinite $A$-algebras is monadic over $\mathbf{Stone}$. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Proof sketch</strong>. First we observe that the full subcategory $Pro\mathbf{A}_f$ on profinite $A$-algebras is the pro-completion of the category $\mathbf{A}_f$ of finite $A$-algebras (it can found in a Remark of Johnstone's Stone Spaces on profiniteness). Also, profinite algebras are closed under limits in $\mathbf{StoneA}$ and limits in $\mathbf{StoneA}$ are created in $\mathbf{Stone}$, so the forgetful functor $U\colon Pro\mathbf{A}_f \to \mathbf{Stone}$ preserves all limits. By Adjoint Functor Theorem between (co-)LFP categories, this forgetful functor has a left adjoint. Now, given a $U$-absolute pair $f, g\colon X \rightrightarrows Y$, i.e. $f$ and $g$ has an absolute coequaliser $e\colon Y \twoheadrightarrow Z$ in $\mathbf{Stone}$, we can define a topological $A$-algebra on $Z$ so that $Z$ is a quotient algebra of $Y$. Then, a quotient of a profinite algebra is again profinite (by, for example, Theorem 4.3 of <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2422"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2422</a>). Therefore, by Beck's Monadicity Theorem, $U$ is monadic. $\square$</p>

<p>Except the last step (a quotient of a profinite object remains profinite), other steps are fairly standard. Hence, there might be other examples such as:</p>

<p>Now, it's known that t-structures and thick categories play reasonably well together; under reasonable assumptions, a t-structure on a derived category induces a t-structure on the quotient (the main point is that the thick subcategory should be generated by its intersection with the heart).</p>

<p>Let's call a thick subcategory $N$ <strong>i-irrelevant</strong> to a t-structure and object $A$ in its heart if for any object in the intersection of the heart with the thick subcategory $B$, we have the vanishing $$\mathrm{Ext}^j(A,B)=0$$ for all $j\leq i$.

<p>On the other hand, we have the correspondence between vector bundles and finitely generated projective modules, i.e Serre-Swan theorem. In more details, let $A:=C(X)$ be the ring of continuous complex functions on $X$ and for $E$ a vector bundle on $X$, the global sections $M:=\Gamma(E)$ is a finitely generated projective $A$-module. Since $G$ acts on $X$, $G$ also acts on $A$ and if we denote $A^G$ for the invariant subring then we have $A^G=C(X/G)$. Moreover $G$ acts on the category $A$-Mod by twist. Explicitly, if $M$ is an $A$-module and $g\in G$, then the twisted module $M^g$ is the same as $M$ as sets but with different $A$-module structure, i.e for $a\in A$, $m\in M$ we have $a\cdot_g m:=g(a)\cdot m$.

<p><strong>The difference</strong> $\ $ The two types of ultraproduct are the same if either none of the sets $X_i$ are empty or almost all of them are empty.  But in the remaining case, where at least one $X_i$ is empty but the set of such $i$ is not large enough to belong to $\mathcal{U}$, they're different: the Type 1 ultraproduct is empty but the Type 2 ultraproduct is not. </p>

<p><strong>The question</strong> $\ $ I've read in a couple of texts (both coming from the point of view of categorical logic) that the Type 2 ultraproduct is really the right one.  But why?  On what criteria is Type 2 judged to be better than Type 1?</p>

<p><strong>A vague guess at an answer</strong> $\ $ I think I can guess <em>very</em> roughly what's going on.  There's been a tradition in logic &mdash; maybe dying out now? &mdash; of taking all structures to be nonempty by definition.  But when you move to the more general setting of categorical logic, that's no longer a satisfactory approach.  Although in the category of sets, there's just a single object with no elements, in many other categories, there are lots of interesting objects with no (global) elements: e.g. there are lots of interesting sheaves with no global sections.  </p>

<p>So categorical logic sometimes involves a recasting of classical, set-based logic, in order to handle empty sets/types satisfactorily.  I imagine that something of the sort is going on here.  (I only defined ultraproducts of sets, but you could of course define ultraproducts of objects of any other sufficiently complete category.)  But still, I don't see clearly why Type 2 is the right choice.  </p>

<p>Recall that in the category of Topological spaces or in the category of Manifolds, a <em>submersion</em> is a (not necessarily surjective!) map $f: X \to Y$ so that for each point $x\in X$, there exists open neighborhood $f(x) \in U \subseteq Y$ and a map $g: U \to X$ splitting $f$, i.e. $f \circ g = \operatorname{id}_U$.  This definition does not generalize well to other categories: it requires at least that ""points"" know a lot about the objects, and that we know what are ""open neighborhoods"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My question is: How much extra ""abstract nonsense"" structure do I need to put on a category for it to have a good theory of submersions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the one hand, the surjective submersions of manifolds are all <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/regular+epimorphism"">regular epimorphisms</a> (does this characterize the surjective submersions?), and so I could imagine defining ""submersion"" to mean a map that factors as a regular epi and a regular mono (I think that the regular monos in manifolds are the open embeddings?).  Then it seems that I don't need <em>any</em> extra structure, but I have not checked that this conditions characterizes submersions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, (surjective?) submersions form a <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Grothendieck+pretopology"">Grothendieck pretopology</a>, and hence determine a Grothendieck topology.  Conversely, I would have assumed that a Grothendieck topology (which is extra structure on a category) determines which maps are submersions, although I am sufficiently new to this that I don't have a proposal for such a definition.</p>

"<p>A ring (say unital for simplicity) is semiprimitive (or Jacobson semisimple) if its Jacobson radical is trivial, or equivalently it has faithful semisimple module.  Semiprimitivity is a Morita invariant, meaning that if $R$ and $S$ are unital rings and the categories of (left) $R$-modules and $S$-modules are equivalent, then $R$ is semiprimitive iff $S$ is semiprimitive.  In some sense, this should say that semiprimitivity is a categorical notion, i.e., there should be some way to define semiprimitivity for abelian categories (maybe with some extra structure like enough projectives or something) so that $R$ is semiprimitive iff the category of $R$-modules is semiprimitive.  </p>

<p>The proof of Morita invariance doesn't go through categorical notions.  One first has that if $R$ is Morita equivalent to $S$, then $S$ must be isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of a finitely generated projective $R$-module.  Therefore, $S$ looks like $eM_n(R)e$ for some idempotent $e$.  If $M$ is a faithful semisimple $R$-module, then one easily check $eM^n$ with the obvious module structure is a faithful semisimple $eM_n(R)e$-module.  </p>

<p>The reliance on $M_n(R)$ in this proof (and hence on free $R$-modules) bothers me particularly because free $R$-modules cannot be defined categorically without specifying an underlying set functor.</p>

<p>My motivation is that I have a particular family of rings for which I am trying to decide semiprimitivity.

<p>Waldhausen gives a beautiful graphical proof that there is an equivalence $F_n F_m C \cong F_m F_n C$ (Lemma 1.1.5). The reason is, basically, that an object in both categories is given by a rectangular array of cofibrations, such that each square is a lattice, which is a <em>symmetric</em> condition. Now, Waldhausen only indicates why this equivalence $F_n F_m \cong F_m F_n$ also preserves cofibrations, and is therefore exact. Namely, he claims that a cofibration in $F_n F_m C$ is a $3$-dimensional diagram satisfying similarly some <em>symmetric</em> condition, but he does not name it explicitly. So what is this condition? So basically the question is: When should we call a commutative cube of cofibrations a lattice?</p>

<p>This got me to thinking that from a category-theoretic point of view, we are used to not having enough colimits (say in geometric settings, like schemes, manifolds, and so on) or limits (for instance in settings like finite groups etc), and this is deftly sidestepped by using a colimit completion. One can consider ind-schemes, or differentiable stacks, etc etc. Why should ETCS be any different, apart from intending to be the primordial category?</p>

<p>What stops me from working, when I need to, in a slightly larger category that is in a sense a colimit-completion of an ETCS category, with the understanding that most of the time I'm interested in objects in my original category, but sometimes constructions I'm interested in sit outside it? The original example above is perfectly well represented as the sequence $k\mapsto \coprod_{0\leq n\leq  k} P^n(\mathbb{N})$, with the obvious inclusions between them.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> The context of the discussion was the effect on ordinary mathematics the discovery that ZFC was inconsistent.

<p>[EDIT: On reflection, I'm putting words into Tom's mouth a little here. The actual point he has made is that <em>if</em> a contradiction were found with using Replacement, it wouldn't affect most mathematicians, but it a contradiction were found in ETCS (equivalently, BZC) then we could start to worry. If we assume that 'ordinary' mathematics is consistent, as it seems to be, then one might make the---justified or not---leap that a little-used axiom is the place a contradiction might be found, if one existed.

"<p>A little bit of background: A graph G is, of course, a set of vertices V(G) and a multiset of edges, which are unordered pairs of (not necessarily distinct) vertices. We say that two vertices v_1, v_2 are adjacent if {v_1, v_2} is an edge. A directed graph, or digraph is essentially the same thing, except that the edges are now ordered pairs. Digraphs have a rather nice categorical interpretation.</p>

<p>A <em>graph homomorphism</em> is exactly what it should be, categorically, if you think of graphs as ""sets with an adjacency structure."" It's a map f: V(G) \rightarrow V(H) is a homomorphism if v_1, v_2 \in V(G) adjacent implies f(v_1), f(v_2) adjacent. The notion of homomorphism for directed graphs is essentially the same; if there's an edge from v_1 to v_2, then there's an edge from f(v_1) to f(v_2). Taking these definitions as morphisms, we can define categories of graphs and of digraphs. </p>

<p>Oftentimes in graph theory (particularly when linear algebra methods come into play), it's easier to work with a digraph than a graph, and so we usually orient the edges arbitrarily. But this isn't really natural...</p>

"<p>My question is long on background and motivation, and almost but not quite answered over at the nLab.  I'll write up a bunch before asking my question (feel free to skip to the end or look at the title), so that (i) those who know more than me can see exactly what I do and do not understand (ii) those that know less than me might learn something (iii) to clarify my own thoughts.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Let $\mathcal S$ be a reasonably nice category: for example, I want it to at least have either all finite limits, or I want it to have a <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/45219/what-abstract-nonsense-is-necessary-to-say-the-word-submersion"">good theory of submersions</a>; and I need some extra conditions (see comments), that I haven't fully thought through, but they should be satisfied in various ""geometrical"" categories like (your favorite convenient category of) Topological Spaces or Manifolds.  A <strong>span in $\mathcal S$</strong> is a diagram $X \leftarrow M \rightarrow Y$, and if I can, I will require that the right map be a submersion.  There is a two-category $\operatorname{Span}(\mathcal S)$ constructed in the usual way: 1-morphisms are spans, and 2-morphisms are maps of spans that cover the identity morphisms on the bases.</p>

<p>A <strong>category object in $\mathcal S$</strong> is a span $X = \{X_0 \leftarrow X_1 \rightarrow X_0\}$ and 2-morphisms $$  \{ X_0 \leftarrow X_0 \rightarrow X_0 \} \overset i \to \{X_0 \leftarrow X_1 \rightarrow X_0\}$$ $$ \{X_0 \leftarrow (X_1 \underset{X_0}\times X_1) \rightarrow X_0\} \overset m \to \{X_0 \leftarrow X_1 \rightarrow X_0\}$$ in $\operatorname{Span}(\mathcal S)$ making $X$ into an algebra object.  (The domain of $m$ is the 1-composition of $X$ with itself in $\operatorname{Span}(\mathcal S)$, and the domain of $i$ is the 1-identity span on $X_0$.)  Writing $\circ$ for the 1-composition in $\operatorname{Span}(\mathcal S)$, the requirement is that the various maps $X\circ X \circ X \to X$ formed from $m,i$ all agree.</p>

<p>A <strong>functor in $\mathcal S$</strong> $\{X_1 \rightrightarrows X_0\} \to \{Y_1 \rightrightarrows Y_0\}$ is a pair of maps $X_1 \to Y_1$ and $X_0 \to Y_0$ making some diagrams commute.  But there tend not to be enough functors when $\mathcal S$ does not satisfy the axiom of choice.  For example, if $\mathcal S$ is the category of manifolds, then certain categories (the groupoids, which I will define in a moment) are supposed to present stacks, but the functor that associates to each manifold $M$ the groupoid of functors $\{M \rightrightarrows M\} \to \{X_1 \rightrightarrows X_0\}$ into some groupoid $X$ does not satisfy the right descent axioms.</p>

<p>Instead, the usual thing to do is to define the notion of ""right-principal bibundles"".  Let $X = \{X_1 \rightrightarrows X_0\}$ and $Y = \{Y_1 \rightrightarrows Y_0\}$ be categories.  An <strong>$X,Y$-bibundle</strong> is a span $B = \{X_0 \leftarrow B_1 \rightarrow Y_0\}$ and 2-morphisms $X \circ B \to B$ and $B \circ Y \to B$, such that all the various 2-morphisms $X \circ X \circ B \circ Y \circ Y \to B$ agree (as above, $\circ$ is the 1-composition in $\operatorname{Span}(\mathcal S)$).  The ""tensor product over $Y$"" gives a ""composition"" of bibundles which is associative up to a canonical associator that satisfies a pentagon.</p>

<p>Given a span $B = \{X_0 \leftarrow B_1 \rightarrow Y_0\}$, there is another span
$$ X_0 \leftarrow (B_1 \underset{X_0 \times Y_0}\times B_1) \rightarrow Y_0 $$
and a ""diagonal"" map from $B$ to this other span.  Let $B$ be an $X,Y$-bibundle.  Using the diagonal map, one can build a map
$$ B_1 \underset{Y_0}\times Y_1 \to B_1 \underset{X_0}\times B_1$$
which is actually a map of objects over $X_0 \times Y_0 \times Y_0$.  On (generalized) elements, this map is $(b,y) \mapsto (b,by)$.  The bibundle $B$ is <strong>right-principal</strong> if this map is an isomorphism.  A category $X$ is a <strong>groupoid</strong> if it is right-principal as an $X,X$-bibundle.  If $X,Y$ are groupoids, a functor $f: X \to Y$ determines an $X,Y$-bibundle where the middle object is $X_0 \underset {Y_0} \times Y_1$, and it is right-principal.</p>

<p>Then the point is that the 2-category whose objects are groupoids in $\mathcal S$ and whose one-morphisms are right-principal bibundles embeds as a full sub-2-category into the category of ""stacks"", which I will not define.  For a precise version of this story, see for example <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0702399"" rel=""nofollow"">C. Blohmann, Stacky Lie groups, 2007</a>.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Any functor of categories in $\mathcal S$ determines a bibundle, but if the categories are not groupoids, then the bibundle is not (usually) right-principal; for example, the identity bibundle is not.  I do want the bibundles of groupoids to be ""morphisms"" of categories, so I don't want to just take functors.  On the other hand, as observed in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0702399"" rel=""nofollow"">Op. cit.</a>, if we don't demand some sort of ""right-principality"" condition, then the 2-category which allows all bibundles as 1-morphisms has neither products nor a terminal object.  Hence my question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the correct notion of ""bibundle"" for (internal) categories that generalizes ""right-principal bibundle of groupoids""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer to my question is almost ""<a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/anafunctor"" rel=""nofollow"">anafunctor</a>"".  An anafunctor seems to have a bit more structure than a bibundle, since it is an object not in $\operatorname{Span}(\mathcal S)$ but in $\operatorname{Span}(\text{categories in }\mathcal S)$.  (Conversely, at least when $\mathcal S$ is the category of sets, bibundles wihout any conditions are the same as <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/profunctor"" rel=""nofollow"">profunctors</a>.)  If I understood better how to go between anafunctors and bibundles, I would probably be happy.</p>

"<p>Recall that a monoidal category $\mathcal C$ is <em>rigid</em> if every object $X\in \mathcal C$ has both left and right duals, i.e. objects $X^l$ and $X^r$ with maps $X^l \otimes X \to \mathbf 1 \to X \otimes X^l$ and $X \otimes X^r \to \mathbf 1 \to X^r \otimes X$ satisfying certain equations.  It is a fundamental fact about monoidal categories that ""having a left dual"" and ""having a right dual"" are <em>properties</em> of an object, not data: given $X$, the objects $X^l$ and $X^r$, if they exist, are uniquely determined up to unique isomorphism.  As such, for a monoidal category itself to be rigid is also property --- the only data is the data of being monoidal.</p>

<p>This should remind you of groups.  Given a monoid $G$, an element $x\in G$ is <em>invertible</em> if there are elements $x^l$ and $x^r$ and equalities $x^l x = 1 = x x^r$.  (Undergraduate exercise: $x^l = x^r$.)  Being invertible is property.  A monoid $G$ is a <em>group</em> if every element therein is invertible.  Thus this too is a property.</p>

<p>In some cases (e.g. algebraic geometry) you don't always want to think about the <em>elements</em> of a group $G$.  Fortunately, there is a very nice way to say when a monoid is a group that does not directly refer to invertibility of elements.  Let $G$ be a monoid and consider the map $G \times G \to G\times G$ (a map of underlying spaces, not of groups) that takes $(x,y)$ to $(x,xy)$.  The monoid $G$ is a group iff this map is an isomorphism (of underlying spaces).</p>

"<p>Fix a complete, cocomplete, symmetric monoidal closed category $\mathcal{V}$. I will also assume that there is a forgetful functor $\mathcal{V}\to \mathbf{Set}$ with a left adjoint.

<p>Now, let $\mathcal{A}$ be a (small) symmetric monoidal closed $\mathcal{V}$-category. Then the $\mathcal{V}$-presheaf category $\mathbf{PShv}(\mathcal{A})$ is symmetric monoidal closed when endowed with the Day convolution structure and the Yoneda embedding is symmetric monoidal closed. Furthermore, any symmetric monoidal $\mathcal{V}$-functor $F:\mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{B}$ with $\mathcal{B}$ cocomplete, lifts uniquely (up to unique isomorphism) to a cocontinuous symmetric monoidal functor $\mathbf{PShv}(\mathcal{A})\to \mathcal{B}$ by taking the left Kan extension $L_{Y}(F)$ of $F$ along Yoneda $Y$.</p>

<p>Q: assume $\mathcal{B}$ and $F$ closed, is $L_{Y}(F)$ closed?</p>

<p>Since Yoneda is closed the converse is trivially true. If the answer is negative in general, is there any criteria to have a positive answer? If it helps the answer, my use case is when $\mathcal{A}$ is the free $\mathcal{V}$-category on a Heyting algebra (e.g. the open sets of a topological space) with monoidal structure the intersection. Since in a lattice there is at most one arrow between two objects, Day convolution degenerates into the pointwise tensor product.</p>

"<p>I feel like this problem has not been solved, but I'm interested in knowing any results on it.  More specifically, I mean:</p>

<p>Let $B\stackrel{f}{\leftarrow} A \stackrel{g}{\rightarrow} C$ be a diagram of Smooth manifolds and Smooth functions, and let $B\stackrel{k}{\rightarrow} D \stackrel{l}{\leftarrow} C$ be the Topological pushout (that is, $D$ obtains a Set structure as the quotient of $B \coprod C$ by the images of $f$ and $g$, and receives the weak Topology induced by $k$ and $l$).  GOAL: Determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the Topological manifold $D$ to receive a natural Smooth manifold  structure making the diagram a Smooth pushout.</p>

<p>To make it seem less daunting, break it into steps:</p>

<p>1) When is $D$ a Topological manifold (that is, inherits a Topological atlas from the diagram)? </p>

<p>2) When does $D$ inherit Smooth transition functions? (or whatever your favorite definition of ""smooth structure"" is)</p>

<p>2') If $D$ does not inherit a Smooth structure from the diagram, can we give it one? (I believe this is just Hirsch-Mazur)</p>

<p>3) Can Smooth functions be defined piecewise?</p>

<p>I'm certain that #1 is most difficult.  Using $A\subset\mathbb{R}=B=C$ and $f,g$ inclusion maps, $A=0$ gives a point with 4 arms (not locally Euclidean) and $A=\mathbb{R}\setminus0$ gives the line with two origins (not Hausdorff).  I find it difficult to find concise conditions that rule out those two situations.  My only idea is to assume that everything is also cellular and try to come up with an obstruction class somehow (hence this question: <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/88842/when-is-a-finite-cw-complex-a-compact-topological-manifold"">When is a finite cw-complex a compact topological manifold?</a>)</p>

<p>I have a few ideas and results for #2.  For example, attaching manifolds along a submanifold (as defined in Kosinski's ""Differential Manifolds"") can be expressed with a smooth pushout diagram, which I proved by making a more general sufficient condition for ""passing"" a Smooth structure from two (or $n$) Smooth manifolds onto a Topological manifold.  My intuition says that the criteria for #3 will be almost the same as for #2</p>

"<p>In the paper <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0778"">lex colimits</a>, Garner and Lack gave a general characterization of ""exactness properties"" for categories (and enriched categories).  A ""lex-weight"" is a weight for colimits whose domain category has finite limits.  If $\Phi$ is a class of lex-weights, then a finitely complete category is ""$\Phi$-lex-cocomplete"" if it admits all $\Phi$-weighted colimits of left-exact diagrams, and ""$\Phi$-exact"" if moreover the functor assigning these colimits itself preserves finite limits.  Intuitively, $\Phi$-exactness of $C$ means that ""all exactness relations between $\Phi$-lex-colimits and finite limits which hold in Grothendieck topoi hold in $C$"", which is justified by a theorem that a small $\Phi$-lex-cocomplete category is $\Phi$-exact just when it embeds in a Grothendieck topos by a functor preserving finite limits and $\Phi$-lex-colimits.</p>

<p>They also gave many examples of ""exactness properties"" which can be characterized as $\Phi$-exactness for some $\Phi$, such as regularity, Barr-exactness, lextensivity, coherency, adhesivity, etc.  In basically all examples, the proof that the given explicitly defined property is sufficient for $\Phi$-exactness proceeds by constructing a subcanonical Grothendieck topology out of the colimits in question and showing that the colimits are preserved by the resulting embedding into the topos of sheaves for this topology.</p>

<p>My question is about whether there is a version of this theory for $(\infty,1)$-categories.  The first part of it seems extremely formal, and I would expect probably works just the same, although obviously there are a lot of details to work out.  At present I am more interested in the construction of examples.  This is interesting for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the $(\infty,1)$-categorical context, for any kind of colimit, there is an obvious notion of ""exactness"", namely ""descent"", as in for example section 6.5 of Rezk's note ""Toposes and homotopy toposes"" or Lemma 6.1.3.5 of <em>Higher Topos Theory</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there is <em>not</em> (yet) a fully general notion of ""Grothendieck topology"" for $(\infty,1)$-categories which suffices to present all Grothendieck $(\infty,1)$-topoi.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here then, at last, is a concrete question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose $C$ is a small $(\infty,1)$-category with finite limits, which also admits colimits of some specified sort, and that these colimits satisfy descent.  Does $C$ necessarily embed in a Grothendieck $(\infty,1)$-topos by a functor preserving finite limits and the specified colimits?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two obvious candidates for such an $(\infty,1)$-topos:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The topos of sheaves on $C$ for the topology whose covering sieves consist of coprojections for the specified colimits.  This almost certainly does not work.  It doesn't even work in general in the 1-categorical case, although in many particular cases it does.  In general, Garner and Lack showed that some additional covering families have to be added to ensure ""postulatedness"" of the colimits.  It's unclear to me whether this will remain possible when we go ""off to $\infty$"".</p></li>
<li><p>The subcategory of presheaves on $C$ which preserve the specified colimits (i.e. take them to limits of $\infty$-groupoids).  This satisfies the embedding property almost by definition, but I don't immediately see why it should be an $(\infty,1)$-topos.  If this worked, it would be a generalization of Remark 6.3.5.17(a) of <em>Higher Topos Theory</em>, but I don't see a way to generalize that proof.</p></li>

<p>Condition II</p>

<p>For any family of maps {$f_{i}:U_{i}\to X$} in $C$ for which there exists ""disjoint union"" $\coprod_{i} U_{i}$, then the induced map $\coprod_{i}U_{i}\to X$ is in $B$ if and only if $f_{i} \in B$ for all $i$.</p>

<p>Let $R$ be a categorical equivalence relation on an object $U \in C$ such that the two canonical projections $\pi_{i}: R\to U$ ($i=1,2$) are both covering maps of $U$ in the topology $T$.</p>

<p>And assume that this categorical equivalence has $T$-quotient $X$. This means that there exists a categorical quotient $p:U\to X$ of $\pi_{i}:R\to U$ such that the induced morphism of associated sheaves (on $T$) $p_{\ast}:h_{U} \to h_{X}$ is a categorical quotient of $\pi_{i \ast}:h_{R}\to h_{U}$ in the category of sheaves of sets on $T$.</p>

Namely, we can view $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and  $\mathcal{P}(Y)$ as poset categories with respect to inclusion, and this turns $f_*$ and $f^{-1}$ into functors (as they preserve inclusions). This seems like the obvious first step, but we can already see that something is wrong, since the pair $(f_*,f^{-1})$ is andjoint, but in the wrong order! Namely, $f_*$ is the left adjoint and $f^{-1}$ is the right (translation: $f(A)\subseteq B \iff A\subseteq f^{-1}(B)$ and not the other way around) as opposed to the situation with sheaves. </p>

<p>Now, we can go further and interpreate the category $\mathcal{P}(X)$ as a category of sheaves on some space. Indeed, it is isomorphic (!) to the category of ""truth-valued"" sheaves on the discrete space on $X$. Under this isomorphism, the functor $f^{-1}$ indeed corresponds to $\bar{f}^{-1}$ (note that no colimit is needed in the definition of $\bar{f}^{-1}$ since the space is discrete). But as we can already expect, $f_*$ does not correspond to $\bar{f}_*$.</p>

$$
f_!(A)=\{y\in Y \mid f^{-1}(y)\subseteq A\}

"<p>The notion of a field (a commutative ring $R$ with $0\neq 1$ and $R^\times=R-\{0\}$) seems to fit uncomfortably into modern algebra. To see what I mean, consider the following statements:</p>

<li><p>The concept of a field seems necessary for the foundation of geometry. For example, the ""Steinitz Exchange Lemma"" (proving that dimension of a vector space is well-defined) seems to require a field. Dimension of a vector space, in turn, seems to underlie all other notions of dimension in mathematics.</p></li>
<li><p>The category of fields is not much of a category. It doesn't have products or coproducts. Every morphism is a monomorphism. It's not connected (there is one connected component for each characteristic). Free fields don't exist. In general, fields do not form an ""equational theory"" so they don't behave like an ""algebraic category"". </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So what is a field, really? Here are a couple suggestions to get you started:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A single field $K$ is something like the category of sets. This is suggested by the analogy between the bifunctor $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(-,-):\mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{op}}\times\mathcal{C}\to\mathsf{Set}$ on a category $\mathcal{C}$ and a bilinear form $\langle -,-\rangle:V\times V\to K$ on a $K$-vector space $V$. It also agrees with the use of the ""ground field"" in algebraic geometry, which is something like the ""universe of discourse"".</p></li>
<li><p>The construction of the splitting field doesn't have an UMP because fields have too many automorphisms. So it seems that ""Galois theory"" is what makes fields special. Perhaps a formalization of Galois theory can help explain what fields really are.</p></li>

<p>Proof sketch:</p>

<p>Consider the functor $Y : C \to psh(D)$, where $psh(D)$ denotes the category of presheaves on $D$ (Yoneda functor, i.e. $Y(X)(A) = Hom (A, X)$). $D$ being dense in $C$ is equivalent to this functor being fully faithful. Futhermore, we have a functor $F: psh(D) \to C$, namely, the one which extends the inclusion $D \to C$ by cocontinuity (as presheaf categories have the property of being free cocompletions: <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+cocompletion"">http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+cocompletion</a>). Then one can see that $Y$ is right adjoint to $F$. So this renders $C$ as reflective subcategory of $psh(D)$ ( <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+subcategory"">http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reflective+subcategory</a>).

<p>You may assume that I have, and am comfortable with, some chosen symmetric monoidal $n$-category $(S,\otimes)$.  I am trying to understand the notion of ""($n$-)category enriched in $S$"".  By this I would like to mean the following.  Roughly,  $A$ is <em>enriched in $S$</em> if $A$ has a set of $0$-morphisms, and between any pair of $0$-morphisms $X,Y \in A$, there is an $S$-object $A(X,Y)$ of 1-morphisms between them.  The composition should be a morphism $A(X,Y) \otimes A(Y,Z) \to A(X,Z)$ in $S$.</p>

<p>I am fairly satisfied that, at least in my example, I can write all of this down explicitly.  Recall that $S$ comes with a chosen object $1 \in S$.  Then the corepresentable functor $S(1,-) : S \to (n-1)\text{-Cat}$ is symmetric monoidal in an essentially unique way.  The usual thing is to use this functor, and define the <em>de-enrichment</em> $A_\delta$ of $A$ to be the $n$-category with hom-$(n-1)$-categories given by $A_\delta(-,-) = S(1,A(-,-))$.  Certainly in my example I can work out this $(n-1)$-category.  (De-enrichment is often a highly lossy operation, and I am OK with that.)</p>

<p>This always holds, for example, if $B=K$ is a field and $A=L$ is a finite separable extension of $K$.  For then, if $\ell\otimes 1 = 1\otimes \ell$ in $L\otimes_K L$, the same clearly holds in $\bar K\otimes_K L$, where $\bar K$ is a separable closure of $K$ containing $L$.  But the $\bar K$-algebra homomorphism $\bar K\otimes_K L\to \bar K^{\mathrm{Hom}_K(L,\bar K)}$ sending $\alpha\otimes\ell\mapsto (\alpha\cdot s(\ell))_{s:L\to\bar K}$ is an isomorphism, and the equation becomes $\ell = s(\ell)$ for all $s:L\to \bar K$.  But this means $\ell$ is fixed by the action of the absolute Galois group of $K$ (which acts transitively on the $s$), so $\ell\in K$.</p>

<p>My motivation comes from the fact that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traced_monoidal_category"">trace</a> on $\mathcal{Bij}$  whose definition is quite simply expressed in terms of the ""disjoint cycle notation"". Namely, suppose given a bijection $\sigma:X\sqcup U\to Y\sqcup U$ for which you want the trace $Tr^U_{X,Y}(\sigma):X\to Y$.

$$Tr^U_{X,Y}(\sigma^~_0)=(124)(35).$$
We simply removed the elements of $U$ from the cycle notation and dropped of the now-empty cycle where $(6)$ was. (There is another traced monoidal category $\mathcal{Bij}'$ with the same objects, but which keeps track of the number of empty cycles.)</p>

<p>By an <em>ordered algebra</em> I mean it has a poset as a carrier, the operations being monotone relative to it. By an <em>ordered variety</em> I mean a collection of ordered algebras closed under morphic images (surjective monotone algebra morphisms), embeddings (subalgebras with inherited order) and direct products (ordered pointwise). There is a corresponding inequational system, which is exactly like  Birkhoff's but necessarily without symmetry.</p>

<p>Note that in the ordered case a two element algebra needn't be subdirectly irreducible e.g. taking no operations and no inequations yields $\mathsf{Poset}$, but the discrete two element set is not subdirectly irreducible via the surjective monotone map to the $2$-chain.</p>

<p>It would be enough to know that every algebra arises as a subdirect product of $2$'s, where in the ordered case the subdirect embedding is also a poset embedding.</p>

<p>He defined it in terms of equivalences of categories of modules, but proved that all equivalences of categories of modules are implemented by tensor product with a bimodule.  (Also by homming from a bimodule.)  It's worth also noting that Morita primarily discussed contravariant equivalences between various categories of modules satisfying some size conditions, rather than covariant equivalences between categories of all modules; his primary interest was on ""dualities"" $\hom_A(-,U)$ and $\hom_B(-,U)$ where $U$ is a fixed $A$-$B$-bimodule.</p>

<p>Eilenberg and Watts independently proved the theorem now named after them jointly, that colimit-preserving functors between categories of modules are given by tensoring with bimodules:</p>

<p>That paper uses (and, as far as I can tell, introduces) the phrase ""Morita context"" for a pair of bimodules $_A P_B$ and $_B Q_A$ and bimodule homomorphisms $P \otimes_B Q \to A$ and $Q \otimes_A P \to B$, not necessarily invertible but satisfying that the two natural maps $P \otimes_B Q \otimes_A P \rightrightarrows P$ agree, as do the two natural maps $Q \otimes_A P \otimes_B Q \rightrightarrows Q$.  I feel like I don't see the phrase ""Morita context"" very much any more, but perhaps this is due to a biased sample on my part.</p>

<p>Notably, ""Chapter II: Categories of Modules and their Equivalences"".  This book never uses the language of bicategories, which should not surprise: the book came out in 1968, which means it went to the publisher by 1967, which means that Bass at the time of writing didn't have Bénabou's paper.  The book does, however, make the following observation: There is a (strict 1-) category whose objects are Rings and whose morphisms are Isomorphism Classes Of Bimodules, and Morita equivalence (not a term used in the book) is isomoprhism in that category.  This <em>almost</em> answers Question 1, but not quite.</p>

<p>I am more interested in the more elementary approach, i.e. establishing an explicit equivalence between the two categories, so that I can understand, morally, why this equivalence ought to hold. The only natural functor I've been able to find between the two is given firstly by factorizing $$\int_{\mathcal{C}}P \overset{\pi_P}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{C} \overset{y}{\rightarrow} \widehat{\mathcal{C}}$$ through the Yoneda embedding to $\widehat{\int_{\mathcal{C}}P}$ and the canonical colimit functor $L : \widehat{\int_{\mathcal{C}}P} \rightarrow \widehat{\mathcal{C}}$ given since $y \circ \pi_P$ is a functor to a cocomplete category, and then getting to $\widehat{\mathcal{C}}/P$ by pullback $p$ along $P \rightarrow 1$. So the end result is a functor $$ p \circ L: \widehat{\int_{\mathcal{C}}P} \rightarrow \widehat{\mathcal{C}}/P$$ Does this functor provide the desired equivalence? There seems to be significant loss of information at $p$, but on the other hand $L$ does have the property that it makes the two respective Yonneda embeddings commute (i.e. $L \circ y = y \circ \pi_P$), so morally it seems that the information lost at $p$ should be the same amount of information lost by the projection $\pi_P : \int_{\mathcal{C}}P \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ (which ought to make $p \circ L$ full and faithful; and I think essential surjectivity is straightforward.)</p>

<p>But I also get the sense I am chatting nonsense. If this functor does nothing of the sort then the question, I suppose, is what is the most elementary functor that provides this equivalence?  </p>

"<p>By a <em>homotopy idempotent</em> I mean a map $f:X\to X$, where $X$ is a space, equipped with a homotopy $f\circ f \sim f$.  In contrast to the situation in <em>stable</em> homotopy theory (where $X$ would be a spectrum or a chain complex), not every homotopy idempotent splits; there is a counterexample in Warning 1.2.4.8 of <em>Higher Algebra</em>.</p>

<p>I'm interested in the dual question of uniqueness: supposing that a homotopy idempotent splits (up to homotopy), can it have multiple inequivalent splittings?  Put differently, can a space have multiple inequivalent retracts that induce the same homotopy idempotent?</p>

<p>The meaning of ""equivalent"" here is somewhat subtle.  A homotopy idempotent is, of course, in particular an ordinary idempotent in the homotopy category, and splittings of ordinary idempotents are unique (up to isomorphism).  Therefore, any two splittings of the same homotopy idempotent must be <em>incoherently</em> homotopy equivalent.  That is, if the first splitting consists of $s:A\to X$ and $r:X\to A$ such that $r\circ s \sim 1$ and $s\circ r \sim f$, and similarly the second consists of $A'$, $s'$, and $r'$, then we must have an equivalence $e:A\simeq A'$ such that $s' \circ e \sim s$ and $e \circ r \sim r'$.  However, these homotopies might not be coherently related to the given ones.</p>

<p>Note that Corollary 4.4.5.7 and Proposition 4.4.5.12 of <em>Higher Topos Theory</em> imply that to give a splitting of a homotopy idempotent is equivalent to extending it to a ""fully coherent idempotent"".  So the question could equivalently be phrased: can a given homotopy idempotent admit multiple inequivalent coherentifications?</p>

<p>One last note: I do mean, as I said, that a homotopy idempotent is <em>equipped with</em> a homotopy $f\circ f \sim f$.  If the homotopy is allowed to vary, then certainly the same underlying map $f$ can admit inequivalent splittings/coherentifications.  For instance, if $f$ is the identity on $S^1 = B\mathbb{Z}$, then in addition to the trivial homotopy $f\circ f \sim f$ there is a nontrivial one, which also admits a splitting, and any splitting or coherentification will remember the difference between these two homotopies.  But if we fix a given homotopy $f\circ f \sim f$, can it be split/coherentified in multiple ways?</p>

<p>I expect the answer is yes, but I would like to see an explicit example.</p>

<p>from which I'm getting most of my facts.</p>

<p>Let me fix, once and for all, a field $\mathbb K$.  I will denote by $\text{Vect}$ the usual category of all $\mathbb K$-vector spaces, and by $\text{FinVect}$ its full subcategory of dualizable objects.  The notions of (coassociative, counital) <strong>coalgebra</strong> and (right, say, and coassociative and counital) <strong>comodule</strong> are standard; briefly, if $(\mathcal V,\otimes)$ is a monoidal category, a coalgebra in $\mathcal V$ is an object $A$ along with a map $A \to A \otimes A$ satisfying some axioms, and an $A$-comodule is an object $X$ and a map $X \to X\otimes A$ satisfying some axioms.  Here's the fast way to say the axioms.  Without telling you anything, it's clear what should be a homomorphism of comodules, namely a map $f: X\to Y$ so that the maps $X \overset f \to Y \to Y\otimes A$ and $X \to X\otimes A \overset{f\otimes {\rm id}}\to Y\otimes A$ agree.  Then a coalgebra $A$ is <strong>coassociative</strong> iff the comultiplication $A\to A\otimes A$ is a homomorphism of $A$-comodules, and a comodule $X$ is <strong>coassociative</strong> iff $X\to X\otimes A$ is a homomorphism of comodules.  (In both cases, the comodule structure on the right is just the comultiplication in the second factor.)  I will abuse language so that all coalgebras and comodules are coassociative.  Oh, and I haven't said anything about counits, but I want them as well.  Given a coalgebra $A$, I will denote its category of right comodules by $\text{Comod}_A$, and of finite-dimensional right comodules by $\text{FinComod}_A$.</p>

<p>Let's say that a <strong>Tannakian category</strong> is a $\mathbb K$-linear (i.e. $\text{Vect}$-enriched) abelian category $\mathcal C$ along with a faithful exact $\mathbb K$-linear functor $F: \mathcal C \to \text{FinVect}$.  (If this is not the most standard definition, let me know.)  The fundamental theorem is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Theorem (c.f. Op. cit.):</em> Let $F: \mathcal C \to \text{FinVect}$ be any functor from any category.  Then there is a coalgebra $\operatorname{End}^\vee(F) \in \text{Vect}$ given by a certain natural colimit (take the definition of the vector space of natural transformations and turn all arrows around; use the fact that the endomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space is naturally a coalgebra).  The functor $F$ factors through $\text{FinComod}_{\operatorname{End}^\vee(F)}$ (and its forgetful functor to $\text{FinVect}$), and $\operatorname{End}^\vee(F)$ is universal with respect to this property (if $F$ factors through $\text{forget}: \text{FinComod}_A \to \text{FinVect}$, then there is a map $\operatorname{End}^\vee(F) \to A$ inducing this).  If $(\mathcal C,F)$ is Tannakian, then the map $\mathcal C \to \text{FinComod}_{\operatorname{End}^\vee(F)}$ is an equivalence of categories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It follows from the above theorem that there is an equivalence of categories between:
$$ \{\text{Tannakian categories}, \text{strictly commuting triangles}\} \leftrightarrow \{\text{coalgebras}, \text{homomorphisms}\}$$
By a ""strictly-commuting triangle"" of Tannakian categories $(\mathcal C,F) \overset{f}\to (\mathcal D,G)$, I mean a functor $f: \mathcal C \to D$ so that we have strict equality $F = G\circ f$ as functors $\mathcal C \to \text{Vect}$.</p>

<p>But when talking about functors, etc., it's <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/evil"">evil</a> to think about strict equality.  Rather, there should be some two-categories floating around.  There is a natural two-category whose objects are coalgebras: the one-morphisms are bicomodules, the two-morphisms are homomorphisms of bicomodules, and the one-composition is cotensor product of bicomodules.  There are, to my mind, a few different two-categories whose objects are Tannakian categories: perhaps the one-morphisms should be triangles that commute up to specified natural isomorphism (""strong""?), or up to specified natural transformation in one way or in the other (""lax"" and ""oplax""?).</p>

<p>All together, my question is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Question:</em> What is the correct, non-evil two-category of Tannakian categories so that the last two sentences of the ""Tannaka theorem"" above expresses an equivalence of two-categories </p>
  
  <p>$\{\text{Tannakian categories}\} \leftrightarrow \{\text{coalgebras}, \text{bicomodules}, \text{homomorphisms}\}$?  </p>
  
  <p>Is this two-category a full sub-two-category of some larger two-category whose objects are pairs 
  $(\mathcal C, F:\mathcal C \to \text{Vect})$ with no further conditions?  If so, does the full theorem represent some sort of ""Tannakaization"" of such pairs?</p>

In the language of recent work of Ando, Blumberg and Gepner such functors can be thought of as bundles (i.e. locally constant sheaves) of $\mathbb{S}$-modules over $X$, or as $X$-parameterized spectra. In the case that we have a <em>space</em> parameterized by $X$, we know relatively obviously that $\Omega X$ acts on the fiber over the base point.

If you have to 'interesting' full subcategories $C_1,C_2$ of $Gpd(S)$ that are fibred over $S$ via the object functor, then their intersection is again fibred (this is a trivial observation).</p>

<p>In particular, if we consider $S = Sch$ (or even relative schemes), then we get a fibration $Gpd(Sch) \to Sch$.

"<p>In Mac Lane, there is a definition of an arrow between adjunctions
called a map of adjunctions. In detail, if a functor $F:X\to A$ is left
adjoint to $G:A\to X$ and similarly $F':X'\to A'$ is left adjoint to
$G':A'\to X'$, then a map from the first adjunction to the second is a
pair of functors $K:A\to A'$ and $L:X\to X'$ such that $KF=F'L$,
$LG=G'K$, and $L\eta=\eta'L$, where $\eta$ 
and $\eta'$ are the units of the first and second adjunction. (The
last condition makes sense because of the first two conditions; also,
there are equivalent conditions in terms of the co-units, or in terms
of the natural bijections of hom-sets).</p>

<p>As far as I can see, after the definition, maps of adjunctions do not
appear anywhere in Mac Lane.  Googling, I found this definition also
in the <a href=""http://unapologetic.wordpress.com/2007/07/30/transformations-of-adjoints/"">unapologetic mathematician</a>,
again with the motivation of being an arrow between adjunctions.  </p>

<p>But what is the motivation for defining arrows between adjunctions 
in the first place?  I find it hard to believe that the only
motivation to define such arrows is, well, to define such arrows... </p>

<p>So my question is:  What is the motivation for defining a map of
adjunctions?  Where are such maps used?</p>

<p>Besides the unapologetic mathematician, the only places on the web
where I found the term ''map of adjunctions'' were sporadic papers,
from which I was not able to get an answer to my question (perhaps
''map of adjunctions'' is non-standard terminology and I should have
searched with a different name?). </p>

<p>I came to think about this when reading <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/11622/what-is-the-right-universal-property-of-the-completion-of-a-metric-space"">Emerton's first answer
to a question about completions of metric spaces</a>.
In that question, $X$ is metric spaces with isometric embeddings, $A$
is complete metric spaces with isometric embeddings, $X'$ is metric 
spaces with uniformly continuous maps, $A'$ is complete metric
spaces with uniformly continuous maps, and $G$ and $G'$ are the
inclusions.  Now, if I understand the implications of Emerton's answer
correctly, then it<br>
is possible to choose left adjoints $F$ and $F'$ to $G$ and $G'$ such
that the (non-full) inclusions $A\to A'$ and $X\to X'$ form a map of
adjunctions.  This made me think whether the fact that we have a map
of adjunctions has any added value.  Then I realized that I do not
even know what was the motivation for those maps in the first place.</p>

<p>One question that can be asked in this vein is whether a given graph could be the underlying graph of a category. This has been answered for finite graphs by Samer Allouch in his thesis. Sadly, the thesis is in French and I can't really understand it. Here is a nice <a href=""http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2011/03/which_graphs_can_be_given_a_ca.html"">n-Category Cafe post</a> about this. In that post someone asked for an explanation of the results or ideas in English, but that was never given. I'd love to hear about this if anyone here knows about it, but my question is more general. Since most categories I come across and understand are not finite (nor even small), I'm wondering about the existence of work connecting large categories with graph theory.</p>

<p>Because this is very vague, I came up with a few specific questions. However, if all I get is reference requests which have nothing to do with these questions I'll still be happy. In particular, I'd love to hear about times questions similar to those below have been asked and answered, or to get a recommendation for a textbook on category theory which focuses on the underlying graph more than Maclane does.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) Has anyone classified (sub)graphs which correspond to <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/replete+subcategory"">replete</a> subcategories? For instance, is there a purely graph theoretic test for whether or not a subgraph $\mathcal{H}$ of $G$ underlies a replete subcategory $\mathcal{D}$ of $\mathcal{C}$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's what I can tell so far about this problem: for each non-isomorphic object in $\mathcal{D}$ you will get a complete graph in $H$. Composition morphisms ensure that if there is any arrow from one vertex to another vertex in a different complete subgraph then there will be arrows from all vertices in the first complete subgraph to all in the second. So $H$ will need to look like a disjoint union of complete graphs, where complete here means for every two vertices there's an edge at least one way between them. One reason this is hard for me to wrap my brain around is that we're dealing with subgraphs of uncountable graphs in which vertices can have uncountable degree. I can solve this by restricting to isomorphism classes of objects, but I'm not sure this is a good idea. I'd love to hear from those more versed in category theory about the pros/cons of restricting to isomorphism classes. Note that the version of this question for full subcategories is answered by ""induced subgraphs"" and so it seems like you have no hope of classifying thick subcategories or other interesting full subcategories. I originally asked this question for <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dense+subcategory"">dense subcategories</a> and the helpful comment of David Roberts below shows you won't have success here because going to the underlying graph loses composition data. </p>

"<p>It is well-known that the category of local rings and <em>ring</em> homomorphisms admits an axiomatisation in coherent logic. Explicitly, it is the coherent theory over the signature $0, 1, -, +, \times$ with the usual axioms for rings, plus the axioms
$$0 = 1 \vdash \bot$$
$$\top \vdash (\exists b . \; a \times b = 1) \lor (\exists b . \; (1 - a) \times b = 1)$$
See, for example, [<em>Sheaves in Geometry and Logic</em>, Ch. VIII, §6]. Unfortunately, because homomorphisms are only required to commute with the various things in the signature, the homomorphisms here are just ring homomorphisms and need not be local. It appears to me that the neatest way to fix this is to introduce a unary relation symbol $(\quad) \in \mathfrak{m}$, with the intention that $\mathfrak{m}$ is interpreted as the unique maximal ideal of the local ring. Then, by the usual rules for homomorphisms of models, a homomorphism $R \to R'$ must map elements of $\mathfrak{m}$ to elements of $\mathfrak{m}'$. But is there a way to axiomatise the theory so that</p>

<ol>
<li><p>we get a coherent, or at least geometric theory, and</p></li>
<li><p>the category of models in $\textbf{Set}$ is indeed the category of local rings and local ring homomorphisms, and</p></li>
<li><p>the structure sheaf homomorphism $f^\ast \mathscr{O}_{Y} \to \mathscr{O}_{X}$ of morphism of locally ringed spaces $X \to Y$ is a homomorphism in the category of models for this theory?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ideally, we'd like to define $\mathfrak{m}$ to be the subsheaf of nowhere invertible sections defined by
$$\{ s \in \mathscr{O} : \nexists t . \; s \times t = 1 \}$$
but unfortunately $\nexists t . \; s \times t = 1$ is not a geometric formula. (The formula $\forall t . \; s \times t \ne 1$ is equivalent to the previous one but has the same defect.) We can salvage one half of the biimplication as the geometric sequent
$$(a \in \mathfrak{m}) \land (\exists b . \; a \times b = 1) \vdash \bot$$
which merely expresses the requirement that ""$a$ is not in $\mathfrak{m}$ if $a$ is invertible"", but we also need to express the requirement that ""$a$ <em>is</em> in $\mathfrak{m}$ if $a$ is <em>not</em> invertible"". One possibility is the following:
$$\top \vdash (\exists b . \; a \times b = 1) \lor (a \in \mathfrak{m})$$
These two axioms appear to give the correct characterisation of $\mathfrak{m}$ in intuitionistic first order logic: it is easy to derive from these axioms that
$$a \in \mathfrak{m} \dashv \vdash \nexists b . \; a \times b = 1$$
so the interpretation of $\mathfrak{m}$ is completely determined by the axioms, at least in a topos. </p>

<p>But does every local ring object (in the sense of the first paragraph) admit an $\mathfrak{m}$ satisfying these axioms? The answer appears to be no, for the reason that these axioms assert that a every section of a sheaf of a local ring admits an open cover of the space by open sets on which the restriction is either invertible or nowhere invertible – and this is certainly not true in the contexts of interest.

$$

Here $Z(G)$ denotes the center of $G$.
One easily checks that $\partial(Z_F)\subset Z_G$. We write $\partial_Z$ for the induced homomorphism
$\partial_Z\colon Z_F\to Z_G.$
We say that the abelian crossed module $\partial_Z\colon Z_F\to Z_G$ is the <em>center</em>
 of the crossed module $\partial\colon F\to G$.</p>

<p><em>Definition.</em> A crossed module $F\to G$ is called  <em>quasi-abelian</em>,
if the morphism of crossed modules
$$
(Z_F\to Z_G)\to (F\to G)
$$
is a quasi-isomorphism. This means that the induced homomorphisms
$$
\ker\partial_Z\to\ker\partial\ \ \text{ and }\  \ {\rm coker}\ \partial_Z\to{\rm coker}\ \partial
$$
are isomorphisms. In other words,</p>

<p>(i) $\partial(F)\cdot Z_G=G$  and</p>

<p>(ii) $\partial(Z_F)=Z_G\cap \partial(F)$.</p>

<p>We obtain an example of a quasi-abelian crossed module $G^{\rm sc}\to G$
from a connected reductive group $G$ over a field $k$ of characteristic 0.
Here $G^{\rm sc}$ is the universal covering of the commutator subgroup $G^{\rm ss}:=[G,G]$ of our reductive group $G$.
We have a differential
$$
\partial\colon  G^{\rm sc}\twoheadrightarrow G^{\rm ss}\hookrightarrow G.
$$
By functoriality, $G$ acts on $G^{\rm sc}$ on the right.
Let $\bar k$ denote an algebraic closure of $k$, then we obtain  a quasi-abelian crossed module
$G^{\rm sc}(\bar k)\to G(\bar k)$.</p>

<p>A <em>braiding</em>  of a crossed module $F\to G$ is a map

\{\ \} \colon G\times G \to F,\ g_1,g_2\mapsto \{g_1,g_2\}
$$
satisfying certain conditions, in particular,
$$
\partial\{g_1,g_2\}=g_1^{-1} g_2^{-1} g_1 g_2.
$$
A braiding is called symmetric if $\{g_1,g_2\}\{g_2,g_1\}=1$.
A braiding  is called Picard if it is symmetric and also $\{g,g\}=1$.</p>

<p>We define a canonical braiding of a quasi-abelian crossed module as follows.
Let $g_1,g_2\in G$. By (i) we can write
$$
g_1=z_1\cdot\partial(f_1),\ g_2=z_1\cdot\partial(f_2), \ \text{ where } z_1,z_2\in Z_G.
$$
Then we set
$$
\{g_1,g_2\}=f_1^{-1}f_2^{-1}f_1 f_2.
$$
Using (ii), one can prove that this braiding is well defined.
It is symmetric and even Picard. We see that any quasi-abelian crossed module admits a Picard braiding.</p>

<p>Now, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_order"">cyclic ordering</a> is more naturally a ternary relation! Its version of transitivity states that $(a,b,c)\wedge(a,c,d)\to(a,b,d)$. A cyclic ordering is also cyclic: $(a,b,c)\to(b,c,a)$. If you hunt around Wikipedia you can find a few different kinds of cyclic orders with more or less restrictive axioms. For this question, let's understand ""cyclic order"" broadly, so it might be strict or not, and it might be total or not: whatever is convenient!</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Would it be useful to model cyclically ordered sets as categories? How would you do it?</p>

<p>I'm guessing that higher categories might be useful, so that you can replace the ternary relation $(a,b,c)$ with a 2-morphism like $(a\rightarrow b)\Rightarrow(a\rightarrow c)$, and there could be a composition of 2-morphisms like
$$\left[(a\rightarrow b)\Rightarrow(a\rightarrow c)\right]\times\left[(a\rightarrow c)\Rightarrow(a\rightarrow d)\right]\mapsto\left[(a\rightarrow b)\Rightarrow(a\rightarrow d)\right].$$
But I'm getting way out of my depth here! I've skimmed over some higher categories on nLab, and I don't see a kind of 2-morphism that does quite what I want. Simplicial 2-morphisms looked promising at first, but they don't seem to compose in the right way. Is that idea a dead end?</p>

<p>Note that I'm <em>not</em> asking about any category of monotone functions between cyclically ordered sets. At least, I don't think that's what I'm asking.</p>

<p>This question was <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/456065/what-kind-of-category-is-a-cyclically-ordered-set"">previously asked on Math.SE</a>, but it hasn't prompted an answer.

"<p>It's been a long time since I posted the following <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/435166/generalization-of-analytic-functors"">question</a> on stackexchange.</p>

<p>Now I think it's better to adress it to you, in the hope I will reach the right audience: Martin's comment, albeit useful, didn't help me to satisfy my curiosity.</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>A functor $F\colon \bf Sets\to Sets$ is said to be <em>analytic</em> if it results from the left Kan extension of a functor $f\colon \mathbf{Bij}(\mathbb N)\to \bf Sets$ (the ""species"" of the functors $F$) along the natural inclusion $\mathbf{Bij}(\mathbb N)\to \bf Sets$, where $\mathbf{Bij}(\mathbb N)$ is the category having objects natural numbers and where $\mathbf{Bij}(\mathbb N)(m,n)$ are the bijective functions $\{1,\dots,m\}\to \{1,\dots,n\}$ (empty if $n\neq m$). Representing a left Kan extension as a coend it means that
$$
F(T)\cong \int^n T^n\times f(n)
$$
(the most of you will recognize the fact that a functor is ""anaytic"" if it can be written in Taylor form, and the coend is in a suitable sense exactly that Taylor series) This can be expressed replacing $\bf Sets$ with any symmetric monoidally cocomplete category: there is a functor $\mathbf{Bij}(\mathbb N)^\text{op}\times \mathcal V\to \mathcal V\colon (n,V)\mapsto V\otimes\dots\otimes V=V^{\otimes n}$, which allows to define 
$$
\int^n V^{\otimes n}\otimes f(n)
$$
for any ""species"" $f\colon \mathbf{Bij}(\mathbb N)\to \mathcal V$.</p>

<p>In the case of $\bf Sets$, it seems to be possible to extend the definition of an analytic functor to the case of an arbitrary cardinal $\kappa$: </p>

<ol>
<li>the category $\mathbf{Bij}(\kappa)$ is defined to be the category having objects cardinals $&lt;\kappa$ and $\mathbf{Bij}(\kappa)(\mu,\nu)$ bijections between those cardinals (hence empty if $\mu\neq\nu$).</li>
<li>I say that a functor $F\colon\bf Sets\to Sets$ is $\kappa$-analytic if it results from $\text{Lan}_jf$ in the diagram
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\mathbf{Bij}(\kappa) &amp;\to&amp; \bf Sets \\
\downarrow&amp;\nearrow_F&amp;\\
\bf Sets &amp;
\end{array}
$$
$F(T)\cong \int^{\mu}T^\mu\times f(\mu)$ where $T^\mu$ is the product of $\mu$ copies of $T$, in the obvious sense.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now my question: can I define something analogous in the case of a generic monoidal(ly cocomplete) category, maybe imposing some additional property? In the end all boils down to the possibility of defining a $\kappa$-fold tensor product $\otimes\colon \mathcal V^\kappa\to \mathcal V$, for any cardinal $\kappa$. Modules over a ring $R$ seem to have this ""extension property"", together with sets. </p>

<p>Being these two very explicit and natural examples of a monoidal category where ""tensoring has an arbitrarily large arity"", I think the problem has its own interest, and I would be surprised if the topic was new.</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>As I pointed out in the comments on math.SE, I was motivated by Martin's <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/11767/infinite-tensor-products"">topic</a> about k-ary tensors in $Mod_R$ to pose the question in the form of a ""k-ary tensor product"". I think there is no hope to recover ""usual properties""; it's better to think about an axiomatization of the structure I need, but for the moment I don't have the slightest idea. I repeat myself: on the one side I find quite astounding the lack of a theory of those monoidal categories where tensoring has an arbitrarily large arity, and on the other, it's obviously due to the absence of ""good"" properties for such a structure.</p>

"<p>A rig is an algebraic object with multiplication and addition, such that multiplication distributes over addition and addition is commutative. However, instead of requiring that the set forms an abelian group under addition, we require only that it forms an abelian monoid. A commutative rig is a rig in which multiplication induces an abelian monoid.</p>

<p>A distributive category is a small category with finite products and coproducts, which I'll denote * and + respectively, such that the canonical morphism X * Y + X * Z \rightarrow X * (Y+Z) is an isomorphism. Essentially, taking products distributes over taking coproducts.</p>

<p>There's an apparent formal similarity between the definitions, and in fact you can get a commutative rig out of a distributive category C by taking the objects of the rig to be isomorphism classes of objects in the category (equivalently, considering the skeletal category) and letting coproducts correspond to addition and products to multiplication. For instance, if you start with the category of finite sets, you can skeletonize to obtain a commutative rig isomorphic to the rig of natural numbers.</p>

<p>So the question is, does every commutative rig arise this way from some distributive category? I suspect the answer is ""no,"" and I can even think of some likely counterexamples (the nonnegative real numbers, Z), but I don't see an obvious way to prove that they are counterexamples.</p>

<p>Supposing that my hunch is correct, is there a nice way to classify the rigs that do arise in this manner? Is there a way to classify the commutative rings that arise when you add negatives to these rigs (analogously to the Grothendieck group)?</p>

"<p>Hey. I have a few off the wall questions about topos theory and algebraic geometry.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do the following few sentences make sense? </li>
</ol>

<p>Every scheme X is pinned down by its Hom functor Hom(-,X) by the yoneda lemma, but since schemes are locally affine varieties, it is actually just enough to look at the case where ""-"" is an affine scheme.  So you could define schemes as particular functors from CommRing^op to Sets.  In this setting schemes are thought of as sheaves on the ""big zariski site"".</p>

<p>If that doesn't make sense my next questions probably do not either.</p>

<p>2 The category of sheaves on the big zariski site forms a topos T, the category of schemes being a subcategory. It is convenient to reason about toposes in their own ""internal logic"". Has there been much thought done about the internal logic of T, or would the logic of T require too much commutative algebra to feel like logic?  Along these lines, have there been attempts to write down an elementary list of axioms which capture the essense of this topos?  I am thinking of how Anders Kock has some really nice ways to think of differential geometry with his SDG.</p>

<p>3 What is it about the category of commutative rings which makes it possible to put such a nice site structure on it, but not other algebraic categories? Gluing rings together lead to huge advancements in algebraic geometry. What about gluing groups?  Is there a nice Grothendieck topology you could put on Groups^op, and then you could start studying sheaves on this site? If not, why not - what about rings makes them so special?</p>

<p>4 Why do people work with the category of schemes instead of the topos of sheaves on CommRing^op - toposes have every nice categorical property you could possibly ask for.</p>

<p>About me:  I am a 1st year grad student who is taking a first course on schemes, and I just have a lot of crazy ideas floating around.  I don't feel comfortable engaging in such wild speculation with my professors.  Could you offer any insight into these ideas?</p>

With the same setup, let $(F\Downarrow G)\;$ denote the category with the same objects but slightly different morphisms, the only difference being that the natural transformation point the other way:
$$Ob(F\Downarrow G)=\{(c,d,\ell)\;|\;c\in Ob(C), d\in Ob(D), \ell\colon F(c)\to G(d)\}$$

"<p>I'm curious to find out where the viewpoint of higher categories may be useful so here is a somewhat vague question (which may or may not have a reasonable answer).</p>

<p>Given a triangulated category, one can consider the set of all possible t-structures on it. Simple examples where one can compute things by hand indicate that this is something complicated but not hopelessly so. See for example the paper <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0552"">http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0552</a> by Jon Woolf which describes a three parametric family of t-structures on the constructible bounded derived category of $\mathbf{P}^1(\mathbf{C})$ stratified by a point and its complement. Some of these t-structures are more interesting than others and there is one that is the most interesting of them all since by taking the bounded derived category of its heart one gets back the triangulated category one started with. (For that t-structure the heart is the category of perverse sheaves on $\mathbf{P}^1(\mathbf{C})$.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, the set of t-structures on a triangulated category is interesting since there lurks somewhere the conjectural motivic t-structure whose existence implies Grothendieck's standard conjectures. See the recent paper <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1116"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1116</a> by Beilinson.</p>

<p>On the triangulated categories page of the n-category lab website it says ""Therefore, all the structure and properties of a triangulated category is best understood as a 1-categorical shadow of the corresponding properties of stable (infinity,1)-categories"". See <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/triangulated+category"">http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/triangulated+category</a>. Note that this is quite a strong statement, since it is referring to all, and not just some, properties and structure of a triangulated category.</p>

More generally, how does the higher categorical viewpoint help one understand the set of all (or maybe all ""nice"" in an appropriate sense) t-structures on a given trangulated category, provided it is the homotopy category of a stable $(\infty,1)$ category?</p>

"<p>I am trying to wrap my mind around Tannaka-Krein duality and it seems quite mysterious for me, as well, as its history. So let me ask:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What was the motivation and historical context for works of major contributors to the ""Tannaka-Krein theory"" (in a broad sense)? 
Just to name a few names: Tannaka, Krein, Saavedra, Deligne, Milne, Lurie, (it seems Grothendieck should also be in this list(?)).</p>

<p>Let me explain some points in the history which seems to me puzzling:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Krein"">Mark Krein</a> was a famous Soviet mathematician, but he was an expert in analysis, <strike>it seems it is the only paper by him devoted to algebra</strike> (See discussion below). How did he come to it? Why did he not continue? </p></li>
<li><p>Similar question about  Tadao Tannaka. <a href=""http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.tmj/1178228363"">""His interest in mathematics lied mainly in algebraic number theory""</a>, 
And it seems similar to Krein, it is the only work by devoted to group theory. (See his <a href=""http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.tmj/1178228363"">publication list</a>). </p></li>
<li><p>P. Deligne seems to have devoted quite much efforts on ""Tannakian formalism""  and more generally on tensor categories. What was his motivation? He is a leading algebraic geometer. 
So probably the subject should be quite important in algebraic geometry? What is its importance? </p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannaka%E2%80%93Krein_duality"">Wikipedia article</a> starts with a sentence: ""...natural extension to the non-Abelian case is the Grothendieck duality theory."" What is the role of Grothendieck in this history ? And what is ""Grothendieck duality theory"" - wikipedia links to something not related. </p></li>
<li><p>Important work was done by <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/107095/saavedras-definition-of-tannakian-category"">Saavedra</a>. It seems not so much is known about him,
his motivation, his other works.</p></li>
<li><p>J. Lurie seems to develop the theory further (see e.g. <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/3446/tannakian-formalism"">MO question Tannakian formalism</a>). What is the motivation? </p></li>

"<p>I'm an newbie in category theory, but I want use it to solve a pre-order question I encountered in my research:</p>

<p>Let $X$ be a convex&amp;compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. $f,g: X \rightarrow [0,1]$ are continous functions. I can define three pre-order categories $\mathbb{C}_f,\mathbb{C}_g, \mathbb{C}_{f,g}$ on $X$. Their objects are $X$, and their pre-order relations given by:
$$\forall x,y \in X, x=(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n),y=(y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n)$$
$$x_2=y_2,x_3=y_3,\dots,x_n=y_n, f(x) \le f(y) \Rightarrow (x,y)\in R_f$$
$$x_1=y_1,x_3=y_3,\dots,x_n=y_n, f(x) \le f(y) \Rightarrow (x,y)\in R_g$$
$$R_{f,g} = R_f \cup R_g$$
And the morphisms is generated by completion of $R_f,R_g,R_{f,g}$</p>

<p>So both $\mathbb{C}_f,\mathbb{C}_g$ are just subcategory of $\mathbb{C}_{f,g}$, and the trivial functor between $\mathbb{C}_f$ and $\mathbb{C}_{f,g}$ is order-preserving. In fact $\mathbb{C}_{f,g}$ is the category product of $\mathbb{C}_f$ and $\mathbb{C}_g$.</p>

<p>Now consider the maximum objects $M_f$in $\mathbb{C}_f$(up to isomorphism), they are the limits of category 2. Can I prove that $M_f \cap M_{f,g} \ne \emptyset$ ? Or is their any counter-example in which it is empty?</p>

"<p>I am interested in understanding a certain phenomenon. I am hoping this sort of problem has been studied before, but I don't know the proper terminology and am having trouble finding answers. I am going to describe a baby case for a PROP, but the same basic question makes sense in many other contexts such as universal algebra, operads, etc.   </p>

<p>Suppose that I have a symmetric monoidal category A which I understand fairly well, by which I mean I have at my disposal a nice (finite) presentation of it. For example A could be the universal PROP for commutative Frobenius algebras, so that symmetric monoidal functors from A into a another symmetric monoidal category C are the same as commutative Frobenius algebras in C. For example C could be the category of finite dimensional vector spaces of a field k. In that case such functors are the same as commutative Frobenius algebras over k. </p>

<p>Now I can ask: <strong>When is A faithfully represented in C?</strong></p>

<p>This really could be interpreted in two ways. First we could ask if there is a single faithful representation of A in C, i.e. a faithful functor from A to C. This means that there is a single Frobenius algebra c in C which can detect morphisms in A. In other words if two expressions in the language of A give the same value for the single Frobenius algebra c, then they are in fact the same for any Forbenius algebra in any target category D, including A itself.  </p>

<p>This is a lot to ask. It might be the case that there are no such faithful representations of A in C.  Instead we could ask for a related property. Instead of asking for a single functor to be faithful, we could ask if somehow all functors jointly are faithful in the following sense:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Defintion</strong>: We will say that C <em>weakly detects</em> A if for all morphisms f and g of A, we have $f \neq g$  if and only if there exists some $c:A \to C$ (possibly dependent on f and g) such that $c(f) \neq c(g)$. [Does this go by another name?]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's carry on with the Frobenius algebra example. In this case A has another well-known incarnation. It is the symmetric monoidal category of 2D cobordisms. The objects are closed 1-manifolds and the morphisms are 2-dimensional cobordisms.</p>

<p>Now suppose that C is the category of real vector spaces. Using the classification of surfaces, it is possible (and not too hard) to construct a single Frobenius algebra which which does the job. Essentially we construct a Forbenius algebra which takes a bordism to $x^{2g -2}$ where x is <strike>an irrational number</strike> not a root of unity and g is the genus of the surface. So this C satisfies the strong faithful property. </p>

<p>However this example depends on working over the reals. It might be the case that over other fields there is no single Frobenius algebra that does the job. I don't know the answer, but I would like to know. In the comments below, Noah Snyder gives some reasons we might think this is the case for finite fields. Is there any example which fails the weak detection property?</p>

<p>I am more interested in understanding how we might address this problem abstractly. Are there any techniques for understanding this problem? In the above example I used the connection between A and the bordism category, then I used a (big?) topological theorem (the classification of surfaces) to deduce the detection. I'd like to avoid that if possible and so I am looking for other techniques. Of course I am mostly interested in some other more exotic A, not the Forbenius algebra example I used to motivate. </p>

<p>I suspect that this is probably hopeless, but hopefully I'll gain a better understanding by asking this question. Here is a <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/13154/term-equality-in-algebraic-theories"">related MO queastion</a>.</p>

"<p>This question is a straight-up reference request, but of course I will be grateful for an answer in the event that no references are readily available. Consider a strict $2$-category $\mathbf{C}$ and assume the existence of a $1$-morphism $f:x \to y$ in $\mathbf{C}$ from some object $x$ to some object $y$ and moreover that there are no morphisms from $y$ back to $x$.</p>

<p>That is to say, $f$ is an object in the category $\mathbf{C}(x,y)$ of morphisms from $x$ to $y$ while the category $\mathbf{C}(y,x)$ is empty. To avoid set-theoretic issues, one can safely assume that $\mathbf{C}$ is hopelessly finite: there are finitely many objects, finitely many $1$-morphisms between any pair of objects, and finitely many $2$-morphisms between any pair of $1$-morphisms.

<p>I know that the objects are the same as those of $\mathbf{C}$, and it is clear that the $1$-morphisms in $f^{-1}\mathbf{C}$ from $w$ to $z$ are given by formally augmenting the old morphisms $\mathbf{C}(w,z)$ with ""new ones"" of the form $gf^{-1}h$ where $g:w \to y$ and $h:x \to z$. But what are the $2$-cells? I can describe them in an unweildy case-by-case manner (i.e. old-to-new, new-to-new,...) but was hoping for something nicer that can also be used as a reference. </p>

<p><b>Remarks</b></p>

<p>1) The analogous statements (a) and (b) for coequalizers in the category of locally ringed spaces are <b>true</b>, which can be seen from the construction of coequalizers in LRS (coequalize the topological spaces, and take rings of invariants).</p>

<p>2)  The analogous statements for coequalizers in the category of affine schemes is <b>true</b>: That $C\to B\rightrightarrows A$ is an equalizer is equivalent to the exactness of the $C$-module sequence $0\to C \to B \stackrel{f-g}{\to} A \to 0$, which can be checked in the localizations at prime (or maximal) ideals of $C$.</p>

<p>3)  The analogous statements for good geometric quotients of schemes is <b>true</b>.  That is, working in Schemes/$S$, if we take $W=G\times_S X$, then $X\to Y$ is a good geometric quotient iff $Y_i$ is a good geometric quotient of $W_i\rightrightarrows X_i$ for all $i$.</p>

<p>4) The analogous statements for <i>equalizers</i> of schemes is <b>true</b>, because fibred products can be checked/constructed on open covers, as is essentially proved in Hartshorne chapter II.3.  In fact in any category, pulling back along a morphism preserves all limits, but not colimits, and in particular not coequalizers.</p>

<p>5) If $W=Spec(A),X=Spec(B)$ and $Y$ is their scheme coequalizer, then $Y$ is usually not affine (e.g. when gluing along opens), but $Spec(\cal{O}_Y(Y))$ is the coequalizer in the category of affine schemes.  That is, $\cal{O}_Y(Y)$ is canonically isomorphic to the equalizer $C$ of $f^\sharp, g^\sharp:B\rightrightarrows A$ in rings, whose underlying set is the equalizer in sets.</p>

<p>6) If in (5) $B$ is a local ring, then $Y$ is affine, $Y=Spec(C)$, $C$ is local, and $C\to A$ is a local map.</p>

<p>Since we can always pass from a stack to an equivalent sheaf, one option might be to say the stalk of a stack is (any category equivalent to) the stalk of the associated sheaf of categories. This seems a little roundabout, though? Is there a more intrinsic definition of these categories? </p>

"<p>Recall that the category $\mathrm{SuperVect}$, as a category, consists of pairs of vector spaces, thought of as formal direct sums $V \oplus W\,\Pi$, where $\Pi$ is the ""odd line"".  (Called ""$\Pi$"" because tensoring with it is ""parity reversal"".)
Indeed, there is a good notion of ""direct sum of categories"" in which case, as categories, we have
$$ \mathrm{SuperVect} = \mathrm{Vect} \oplus \mathrm{Vect}\, \Pi$$
As a monoidal category, we declare that the one-dimensional vector space $\mathbf 1 \in \mathrm{Vect}$ is the monoidal unit and that $\Pi \otimes \Pi = \mathbf 1$, and give it the trivial associator (so that as a monoidal category $\mathrm{SuperVect}$ is the category of sheaves of vector spaces on $\mathbf Z/2$ with the convolution product; when $2$ is invertible, which I assume it is, this is also the category of representations of $\mathbf Z/2$).</p>

<p>The interesting part of $\mathrm{SuperVect}$ is its braiding/symmetry.  A braiding $\sigma$ on this monoidal category is uniquely determined by its value on
$$ \mathbf 1 = \Pi \otimes \Pi \overset \sigma \longrightarrow \Pi \otimes \Pi = \mathbf 1 $$
which is just a number $\sigma_{\Pi,\Pi}$.  The axioms of symmetric monoidal category force $\sigma_{\Pi,\Pi}$ to square to $1$, but do not force it to be $1$ itself.  The symmetric monoidal category $\mathrm{SuperVect}$ is determined by declaring that $\sigma_{\Pi,\Pi}$ is the <em>other</em> number that squares to $1$, namely $-1$.</p>

<p>At least over $\mathbb C$,
$\mathrm{SuperVect}$ has the following important property, due to Deligne.  Not every symmetric monoidal category is tannakian over $\mathrm{Vect}$ --- in particular, there does not exist a symmetric monoidal functor $\mathrm{SuperVect} \to \mathrm{Vect}$ --- but every symmetric monoidal category (satisfying some technical bounds on growth rates of objects) is tannakian over $\mathrm{SuperVect}$.</p>

<p>My question is whether this trick can be repeated one dimension higher.  Let $\mathrm{Vect}_{\mathrm{SuperVect}}$ denote the 2-category of all ""supercategories"", i.e. categories with an action by $\mathrm{SuperVect}$.  (I'd rather not make this precise.  Probably I should fill in some words like ""abelian"".  I'd be perfectly happy just working with the 2-category whose objects are the natural numbers and whose morphisms are matrices filled in with supervector spaces, just like one can model $\mathrm{Vect}$ as the category whose objects are natural numbers and whose morphisms are matrices of numbers.)
Then $\mathrm{Vect}_{\mathrm{SuperVect}}$ is symmetric monoidal (because $\mathrm{SuperVect}$ is) with unit object $\mathbf 1$, and with $\mathrm{End}(\mathbf 1)  = \mathrm{SuperVect}$.</p>

<p>Then there's a perfectly good 2-category
$$ \mathrm{SuperDuperVect} = \mathrm{Vect}_{\mathrm{SuperVect}} \oplus \mathrm{Vect}_{\mathrm{SuperVect}} \, \Xi$$
where the letter $\Xi$ is just a formal symbol playing the role of $\Pi$ above.  I would like to give this category a symmetric monoidal structure in which $\Xi \otimes \Xi = \mathbf 1$ but the braiding on $\Xi$ is the endomorphism 
$$ \sigma_{\Xi,\Xi} = \Pi \in \mathrm{End}(\mathbf 1) = \mathrm{End}(\Xi \otimes \Xi). $$
The idea is that this is <em>the other</em> object that squares to $\mathbf 1 \in \mathrm{SuperVect}$.</p>

<p>Now, I should be a bit careful.  Symmetric monoidal 2-categories, when written out in full detail, consist of quite a lot of data and coherence conditions.  Perhaps there's some rule that says that $\sigma_{\Xi,\Xi}$ not only has to square to $\mathbf 1$ but also has to braid trivially with itself.  I don't know, and I'm not sure where to look up the axioms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does such a symmetric monoidal 2-category ""$\mathrm{SuperDuperVect}$"" exist?</p>
  
  <p>Is it symmetric-monoidally equivalent to some more basic thing, say the 2-category of sheaves of supercategories on something with convolution product, or the 2-category of supercategorical representations of something?</p>
  
  <p>Is there a symmetric monoidal 2-functor $\mathrm{SuperDuperVect} \to \mathrm{Vect}_{\mathrm{SuperVect}}$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, if the answer to the first question is ""no"", then the other two are moot.  If the answer to the first question is ""yes"", then I can't imagine positive answers to the other two, but maybe my imagination is faulty.</p>

"<p>This is a slightly pedantic question about the ""2-categorical"" nature of localization. Recall the definition:</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>. A localization of a category $\cal C$ with respect to a class of morphisms $W$ is a category ${\cal C}[W^{-1}]$ together with a functor $q:{\cal C}\to {\cal C}[W^{-1}]$ such that</p>

<ol>
<li>$q$ sends the morphisms of $W$ to isomorphisms;</li>
<li>for any functor $F:{\cal C}\to {\cal D}$ which sends the morphisms of $W$ to isomorphisms, there is a unique functor $G:{\cal C}[W^{-1}]\to {\cal D}$ such that $G\circ q=F$.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that I'm using the ""strict"" version of the definition, which characterizes the category ${\cal C}[W^{-1}]$, if it exists, up to a canonical <em>isomorphism</em> of categories (as opposed to a weaker version that only requires $G \circ q$ to be naturally isomorphic to $F$ and which only characterizes ${\cal C}[W^{-1}]$ up to equivalence).</p>

<p>The above very familiar definition can be rephrased as follows: condition (1) is equivalent to saying that for any category ${\cal D}$, the functor $-\circ q : {\cal D}^{{\cal C}[W^{-1}]} \to {\cal D}^{\cal C}$ factors through the full subcategory ${\cal D}^{({\cal C},W)}$ of ${\cal D}^{\cal C}$ consisting of those functors $F:{\cal C}\to {\cal D}$ which send the morphisms in $W$ to isomorphisms, and the universal property (2) states that the functor $-\circ q : {\cal D}^{{\cal C}[W^{-1}]} \to {\cal D}^{({\cal C},W)}$ is bijective on objects.</p>

<p>But what about natural transformations? It should follow from the above definition that localization is actually ""2-categorical"" in the sense that the functor $-\circ q : {\cal D}^{{\cal C}[W^{-1}]}\to {\cal D}^{\cal C}$ is fully faithful, so that $-\circ q : {\cal D}^{{\cal C}[W^{-1}]} \to {\cal D}^{({\cal C},W)}$ is an isomorphism of categories, not just a bijection between objects.</p>

<p>This would be immediate provided that $q$ is bijective on objects. It is probably obvious that the definition of localization forces this, but I can't see it. It is clear to me that a localization $q$ must be surjective on objects but I'm missing why it must be injective on objects. I'm sure there is a very simple reason, flying straight from the definition, that I'm missing.</p>

<p>Aside: one reason why someone might care about this detail comes from the theory of derivators. To show, for example, how derived categories give rise to derivators one needs to induce natural transformations between functors between derived categories.</p>
",<ct.category-theory>
"<p>In Andreas Blass's famous paper `Seven Trees in One', the existence of a natural bijection between binary trees and 7-tuples of binary trees is related to the equation $T^7 = T$ being satisfied by a complex number which satisfies the equation $T = 1 + T^2$ (the categorification of which is satisfied by the set of binary trees).</p>

<p>In a similar vein, Leinster states that there are (for a non-standard definition of cardinality) $e$ finite sets up to isomorphism. Specifically, for each finite cardinality $k$, there is one way to specify a list of $k$ distinct elements, but this counts each set $k!$ times (one for each permutation), so there are $\dfrac{1}{k!}$ sets of size $k$ and $\dfrac{1}{0!} + \dfrac{1}{1!} + \dfrac{1}{2!} + \cdots = e$ finite sets.</p>

<p>Now, this result can be generalised. Consider a set of $k$ elements, each of which is coloured with one of $m$ non-equivalent colours. Up to isomorphism, there are now $\dfrac{m^k}{k!}$ $m$-coloured sets of size $k$, so $e^m$ finite $m$-coloured sets up to isomorphism.</p>

<p>Let $S_m$ be the collection of finite sets (for concreteness, subsets of $\mathbb{N}$) whose elements are $m$-coloured. Note that $e^m e^n \equiv e^{m+n}$, which suggests the following categorification:</p>

<p>""There exists a natural bijection between $S_m \times S_n$ and $S_{m+n}$.""</p>

<p>I am aware that there is a categorical notion of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_category"">congruence relation</a>. However, this doesn't seem to take the spirit of multiple objects to heart: all it does is keep the same objects and relate morphisms within homsets. For one thing, the accompanying notion of quotient category doesn't correspond to coequalizers in $\mathbf{Cat}$ (of which there are many more).</p>

<p>It is not even clear how to define an ideal of a category. To allow for proper ideals, it probably shouldn't simply be a subcategory.

"<p>[I'd be very happy for a better question title, if anyone has any suggestions.]</p>

<p>I have a category $C$, two functors $F,G : C \to \mbox{Cat}$, a natural transformation $\alpha : F \to G$, and a section $\sigma : G \to F$ of $\alpha$.  I am interested in the colimits of the composites $C \xrightarrow{F,G} \mbox{Cat} \xrightarrow{N} \mbox{sSet}$.  Specifically, calling these $X = \mbox{colim}_C(NF)$ and $Y = \mbox{colim}_C(NG)$, and calling the induced maps again</p>

<p>$$ \alpha : X \stackrel{\curvearrowleft}{\rightarrow} Y: \sigma ,$$</p>

<p>I would like to show that these last maps are inverse weak homotopy equivalences of simplicial sets.</p>

<p>Here are some additional things that I know how to prove about the situation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Both $NF$ and $NG$ are cofibrant in a model structure on $\mbox{Fun}(C,\mbox{sSet}$), so these are also homotopy colimits.</li>
<li>The above diagram induces an isomorphism $\pi_0 X \cong \pi_0 Y$.</li>
<li>For any $c \in C$ and any map $K \to N(F(c))$, the composite $K \to N(F(c)) \hookrightarrow X$ is homotopic to a map of the form $K \to Y \xrightarrow{\sigma} X$.</li>
<li>$N(C)$ is weakly contractible.</li>
</ol>

<p>By item 1, we can also study these homotopy types instead via their Grothendieck constructions, namely the opfibrations $\mbox{Gr}(F) \to C$ and $\mbox{Gr}(G) \to C$; more precisely, Thomason's homotopy colimit theorem says that we have weak homotopy equivalences $X' = N(\mbox{Gr}(F)) \xrightarrow{\approx} X$ and $Y' = N(\mbox{Gr}(G)) \xrightarrow{\approx} Y$, under which identifications the above section diagram becomes equivalent to one</p>

<p>$$ \alpha' : X' \stackrel{\curvearrowleft}{\rightarrow} Y' : \sigma' $$</p>

<p>of (nerves of) opfibrations over $N(C)$.  Now, a section diagram induces one upon application of any functor, so in particular $\alpha'$ is surjective on $\pi_n$ for all $n$ (and all basepoints).  So it would suffice to show that $\sigma'$ is also surjective on $\pi_n$, and by item 2 we only need to check $n \geq 1$.  Note too that it suffices to check on <em>free</em> homotopy classes of maps.  So a precise statement of my question could take the form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do items 3 and 4 suffice to show that any map $K \to X'$ factors through $\sigma' : Y' \to X'$ up to homotopy?  (If it helps, we can take $K$ to be finite and connected, and it even suffices to obtain a factorization-up-to-homotopy $K' \to Y' \to X'$ for some replacement $K' \xrightarrow{\approx} K$.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I'd also be happy if someone suggested an alternative way to prove this weak equivalence.</p>

<p>In general, I don't think we should expect ""spheres in $X'$"" to be detectable by the fibers of the opfibration alone; a toy example illustrating this is the torus fibering over the circle by projection onto one coordinate.  But then there's item 4: I'd really like it to be true that somehow the weak contractibility of $N(C)$ forces it to be the case that any map $K \to X'$ factors up to homotopy through the inclusion of some fiber $N(F(c)) \hookrightarrow X'$ (which would solve the problem).  But this intuition is coming from the undirected case (i.e. the homotopy theory of spaces, not of categories), which means at the very least that it should be taken with a grain of salt.  And unfortunately, $C$ isn't filtered (otherwise this would be easy), and so I don't think I have much control over ""why"" spheres in $N(C)$ are always nullhomotopic.</p>

<p>Note 2. ""none"" mentioned similarity to the <em>sur</em>reals but Sergeyev himself compares his theory to the <em>hyper</em>reals, hence the tag.</p>

<p>Note 3. In a comment accessible <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00283-015-9600-7"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> Sergeyev asserts that ""Levi-Civita numbers are built using a generic infinitesimal $\varepsilon$ ... whereas our numerical computations with finite quantities are concrete and not generic.""  Here apparently ""finite"" is a misprint and should be ""infinite"". How is this comment on the difference between Sergeyev's grossone one the one hand, and the Levi-Civita unit on the other, to be understood?</p>

<p>Note 4. In a 2013 article, Sergeyev compares his grossone to Levi-Civita in the following terms in footnote 5: <em>5 At the first glance the numerals (7) can remind numbers from the Levi-Civita field (see [20]) that is a very interesting and important precedent of algebraic manipulations with infinities and infinitesimals. However, the two mathematical objects have several crucial differences. They have been introduced for different purposes by using two mathematical languages having different accuracies and on the basis of different methodological foundations. In fact, Levi-Civita does not discuss the distinction between numbers and numerals. His numbers have neither cardinal nor ordinal properties; they are build using a generic infinitesimal and only its rational powers are allowed; he uses symbol 1 in his construction; there is no any numeral system that would allow one to assign numerical values to these numbers; it is not explained how it would be possible to pass from d a generic infinitesimal h to a concrete one (see also the discussion above on the distinction between numbers and numerals). In no way the said above should be considered as a criticism with respect to results of Levi-Civita. The above discussion has been introduced in this text just to underline that we are in front of two different mathematical tools that should be used in different mathematical contexts.</em> It would be interesting to have a specialist in numerical analysis comment on Sergeyev's use of the term ""numerical"" to explain the difference between his grossone and an infinite element of the Levi-Civita field.</p>

<p>Note 6. At a different venue (see comment by Daniel Moskovich), Charles Stewart pointed out that ""As it happens, the Grossone numbers considered as polynomials seem to be a generalisation of these REXes [rational exponential expressions], allowing subtraction in addition to the operations I described above. If that's right, then Sergeyev claims to have such a decision procedure."" The question is whether Sergeyeyev has such a decision procedure.</p>

<p>Note 7. My understanding of Gabriele Lolli's <em>answer</em> is that he sees Sergeyev as developing a <em>conservative</em> extension of the intended model of PA, allegedly contrary to previous models; and of Daniel Moskovich's <em>answer</em>, that Sergeyev is adopting standards of rigor of an <em>applied</em> mathematician and therefore should not be judged by the standards of rigor of <em>pure</em> mathematicians.

"<p>It has been known for some time that one can define a topos as a model of a (finitary) essentially algebraic theory (or in other words, can be defined internal to any category with finite limits). In particular, given a topos $E$ (for instance the topos of sets) one can define an internal topos in $E$ (e.g. a small topos). One can ask for stronger (and in fact is easier to define) in an internal <em>universe</em>: this is a category theoretic analogue of a Grothendieck universe. Such a thing gives rise to an internal topos $M$ in $E$ that is in addition a <em>locally full subcategory</em>. The nontechnical definition is that there is an $E$-object $e(x)$ of $M$-elements of any $M$-object $x$ (recall that elements are functions $1 \to x$, here taken in $M$), and (the $E$-object of) functions <em>in $E$</em> between $e(x)$ and $e(y)$ correspond to the $E$-object of functions <em>in $M$</em> between $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>There are toposes, given a metatheory of $ZFC$, that have no universes in this sense, namely the topos of sets in $V_{\omega+\omega}$, much like one cannot prove the existence of Grothendieck universes in vanilla ZFC. </p>

<p>What I'm curious about is the existence of internal toposes that <em>aren't</em> locally full (equivalently, arise from universes). Shouldn't we get the <em>free internal topos</em> in a topos? If we have NNOs, can we get the free internal topos with NNO? Are there good descriptions of these?</p>

<p>Given the topos of ZFC sets, the models of ZC give internal toposes, but I'm interesting in when we can say something about internal toposes without any material meta-theory. In essence: what can be said about ""inner models"" in topos theory? When we build inner models in ZFC (say), we leverage the extra structure that material sets have, for instance the cumulative hierarchy, which is not a priori available to the topos theorist.</p>

<p>Phrasing it like that made me wonder:  is this just the first step?  Should I 'really' be thinking not about morphisms themselves, but about morphisms between morphisms?  Indeed, of the couple of examples I can think of off the top of my head where such $2$-morphisms arise quite naturally, it does seem to be the 'right' thing to do to think about morphisms up to isomorphism (the best example I have in mind is the difference between isomorphism and equivalence of categories, the former not being quite as useful).</p>

"<p>In Jacob Lurie's book Higher Algebra, for an object $M$ of a monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, he constructs a category $\mathcal{C}[M]$ which can be thought of as ""maps in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $A\otimes M\to M$ with associated coherence data"". $\mathcal{C}[M]$ is shown to be monoidal, and algebra objects of this category are shown to be precisely the algebras which coherently act on $M$ (though one algebra that acts on $M$ in two different ways will be thought of as two different objects of $\mathcal{C}[M]$). Moreover, he shows that if $\mathcal{C}[M]$ has a final object, which we'll denote $End(M)$, this object is an algebra object of $\mathcal{C}$ and $M$ is an object of $LMod_{End(M)}$. Thus any algebra that acts on $M$ admits a morphism to $End(M)$. </p>

<p>I'm in particular thinking about the quasicategory of $\infty$-groupoids, $\mathcal{C}=Top$, so $M$ and $End(M)$ and everything else will just be spaces for the rest of this.

This is a monoid object of $Top$ whose monoid structure is given by composition. Moreover there is an evaluation map $ev:Map_{Top}(M,M)\times M\to M$ so there is a corresponding object of $Top[M]$.

<p>Let $f:E'\to E$ be a morphism belonging to $\mathfrak{A}$, and let $g:F\to F'$ be a morphism belonging to $\mathfrak{B}$.  (Note: These are morphisms of topological vector spaces).  </p>

<p>Then we have a map $$\matrix{Hom(E',E) \times Hom(F,F')\to Hom(\lambda(E,F),\lambda(E',F'))\\
(f,g)\mapsto\lambda(f,g)}$$</p>

<p>We say $\lambda$ is of class $C^p$ if for all manifolds $U$, and any two $C^p$ morphisms $U\to Hom(E',E)$ and $U\to Hom(F,F')$, the composition $$U\to Hom(E',E) \times Hom(F,F')\to Hom(\lambda(E,F),\lambda(E',F'))$$
is also of class $C^p$.  (Note: We can replace $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ with categories of tuples to generalize this to several variables.  In fact, this is what we do below.)</p>

<p>It is not hard to show that this induces a unique functor $$\lambda_X:VB(X, \mathfrak{A})^{op}\times VB(X,\mathfrak{B})\to VB(X,\mathfrak{C}).$$  on vector bundles taking values in the appropriate vector bundle categories over $X$.  </p>

<p>We define a <strong>tensor bundle of type $\mathbf{\lambda}$</strong> on $X$ to be $\lambda_X(TX)=\lambda_X((TX,\dots,TX),(TX,\dots,TX))$, where $TX$ is the tangent bundle.  </p>

<p><strong>Definition 1.</strong> A trivial fiber bundle with fiber $F$ is an arrow which is isomorphic to $\pi_1:B\times F\longrightarrow B$ in $\mathsf{C}/B$.</p>

<p><strong>Definition 3.</strong> A fiber bundle with fiber $F$ a locally trivial fiber bundle with fiber $F$, i.e it is locally in the class of projections $X\times F\longrightarrow X$.</p>

<p>If $\mathsf{C}$ is complete, trivial fiber bundles are stable under base change (with invariant fiber). If $\mathsf{C}$ is a complete <s>superextensive</s> site, fiber bundles are stable under base change, also with invariant fiber.

<p>Briefly, a binoidal category consists of a category $C$ and, for each $A\in Ob(C)$ a pair of functors $A\rtimes -$ and $- \ltimes A$ whose action on objects agrees in the following sense: $A\ltimes B=A\rtimes B$; we write this object $A\otimes B$.  Note that the $\otimes$ notation applies only to objects; the closest equivalent for morphisms has two possibilities, which may not be equal.  Given $f:A\to B$ and $g:C\to D$, the composites $A\otimes C\to B\otimes D$</p>

<p>$$f\ltimes D \circ A \rtimes g$$
and
$$B \rtimes g \circ f \ltimes C$$</p>

<p>need not be equal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question 1: is it a consequence of the above definition of binoidal categories that $$f\ltimes(A\otimes B) = (f\ltimes A)\ltimes B$$ and $$(A\otimes B)\rtimes f = A\rtimes (B\rtimes f)$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suspect not: any monoidal category is a binoidal category via $-\otimes\text{id}_A$ and $\text{id}_A\otimes -$, and in a non-strict monoidal category the two morphisms ""equated"" above might not even have the same domain and codomain.  Or perhaps I have made a mistake?</p>

<p>If so, this means that the equation above (and the corresponding rule for $\rtimes$) must be added as an additional part of the definition of a binoidal category.  I have not found this mentioned in the literature.  One is then led to a ""weak"" version where the equation is replaced with a natural isomorphism as below</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question 2: is it a consequence of the above definition of binoidal categories that 
  $$\left(-\ltimes(A\otimes B)\right) \simeq \left((-\ltimes B)\circ(-\ltimes A)\right)$$ and 
  $$\left((A\otimes B)\rtimes -\right) \simeq \left((A\rtimes -)\circ(B\rtimes -)\right)$$ </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does there exist a category $C$ that admits an essentially surjective functor $F: C \to Set^{C^{op}}$? </p>

<p>Terminology: we say that a functor $F: C \to D$ is <a href=""http://ncatlab.org:8080/nlab/show/essentially+surjective+functor"">essentially surjective</a> if every object $d$ of $D$ is isomorphic to some value $F(c)$. This is the good notion of surjectivity for the 2-category $Cat$, or at least one good notion. </p>

<p>As is well-known from categorical circles, the presheaf category $Set^{C^{op}}$ here plays a role of ""power object"" $P(C)$ that is usefully regarded as analogous to power sets in set theory or more generally in toposes. (For example, the Yoneda embedding $y_C: C \to Set^{C^{op}}$ plays a role analogous to the singleton mapping $\{-\}: S \to P(S)$ from set theory.) In fact Tom's question is embedded in a larger discussion of what one should mean by a '2-topos' -- see that discussion for more on the analogy. </p>

<p>So the question above is analogous to one that Cantor's theorem answers: can one have a set $S$ that maps onto its power set $S$? So the expected answer to the question is '<strong>no</strong>'. Note however that the standard diagonalization technique behind Cantor's theorem, as explained for example <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0305282"">here</a>, doesn't apply in any obvious way since there is no general decent notion of diagonal map $C \to C \times C^{op}$. </p>

<p>Regarding foundational issues: I'll leave that up to you. :-) If you want me to impose a constraint, we might add the condition that $C$ is locally small, but note that we'll soon be leaving the land of local smallness anyway, since there is a <a href=""http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/1995/n9/1-09abs.html"">result</a> due to Freyd and Street that if also $Set^{C^{op}}$ is locally small, then $C$ is (equivalent to) a small category, and that would be a <em>huge</em> constraint that makes the question not so interesting. </p>

These things feel bizarre and out-of-place to me - it's all so abstract and dry it's difficult to get a handle on, and feels so removed from """"reality"""" (a.k.a., things I have a geometric intuition for).</p>

<p>I understand that this is a result of my maturity level - I'm only just coming to terms with categorical language, and a few years ago I would have probably made a poor joke about ""abstract nonsense"". Similarly, I have only recently come to love the language of cohomology and sheaves, and this is perhaps because of the problems they solve rather than the language itself; classifying line bundles on a Riemann surface, say, or any of the classical theorems of algebraic topology - both of which can be done elegantly with tools more modern than those questions themselves. I would perhaps feel more at ease if I saw that homotopical algebra can be used for similar purposes, so:</p>

<p>What are some down-to-earth (interesting to non-category theorists, say, that are naturally stated in non-categorical language) questions that have been solved using these sorts of tools, or such that these sorts of tools are expected to be useful?

<h2>The Statement</h2>

<p>Let $C$ be a gerbe on a space $X$ with ""abelian"" band $H$, $f: Y \to X$ a local homeomorphism (this context uses local homeomorphisms in place of open subset sets and covers of open sets).  Given an object $P$ of $C(Y)$, and an $H$ torsor $I$ over $Y$, there exists an object $Q$ of $C(Y)$ such that $I \overset{\sim}{\to} \underline{\text{Isom}}(P,Q)$ as $H$-torsors.  The object $Q$ is called ""the object obtained from $P$ by twisting by the H-torsor $I$"".  </p>

<h2>My Question</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can get a local ismorphism $I \overset{\sim}{\to} \underline{\text{Isom}}(P,Q)$ but how can I see it is, in fact, global?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Some Details / A sketch of the proof</h2>

<p>So you take a surjective local homeomorphism $g: Z \to Y$ so that there is a global section of $g^{-1}I$ (i.e. take a fine-enough open cover so that you have sections of $I$).  Then pulling back this section $s$ under the maps $p_1, p_2: Z \times_Y Z \to Z$    we get two different sections of a sheaf which is a torsor under the pullback of $H$.  So you get this section of the pullback of $H$ and since the pullback of $P$ is also a torsor under this sheaf, you have an automorphism of the pullback of $P$.  This automorphism could also be thought of as an isomorphism $u: p_1^{-1}g^{-1}P \overset{\sim}{\to} p_2^{-1}g^{-1}P$ which satisfies the cocycle condition.  Then by the descent property which this gerbe satisfies, we have an object $Q$ of $C(Y)$ with $\psi: g^{-1}Q \overset{\sim}{\to} g^{-1}P$.<br>
So we started with a  section of the pullback of $I$ (i.e a local section of $I$) and ended with an isomorphism between $P$ and $Q$'s pullbacks (i.e. a local isomorphism).</p>

<p><strong>What information can I use to show that this local isomorphism is in fact an isomorphism?  Or is Brylinski simply abusing language?</strong> </p>

<p>EDIT (2/22/13):  I'm fairly certain I just need to show that on double intersections these local isomorphisms differ by an inner automorphism, but since my band is abelian this would say they glue together.  I just haven't wrapped my head around this idea in the context of local homeomorphisms ans pullback diagrams quite yet.</p>

It is well-known that $\Gamma$ preserves filtered colimits if $X$ is assumed to be quasi-compact and quasi-separated. In other words, $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a compact object. Even more, it can be shown (using the results of EGA I, 6.9) that compact objects are precisely the quasi-coherent modules which are locally of finite presentation. If we define a locally finitely presentable tensor category to be a tensor category $C$, whose underlying category is locally finitely presentable and such that a) $1_C$ is compact, b) the compact objects are closed under $\otimes_C$, then $\mathrm{Qcoh}(X)$ turns out to be such a category.</p>

So the bounds for the $i$ with $s_i \neq 0$ on each $X_j$ are bounded. Why should this happen for a scheme which is not quasi-compact? But in order to prove this, we would have to construct appropriate quasi-coherent modules, and this can only be done my transfinite methods if $X$ is general (see for example <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/39941/does-qcohx-admit-a-generating-set"">here</a>).</p>

"<p><b>Motivation:</b> </p>

<p>Say $F: D \to Sch$ is a diagram in the category of schemes, and we're interested in whether it has a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(category_theory)#Colimits_2"">colimit</a> (gluings, pushouts, and ""categorical"" quotients are all examples of colimits).  Its colimit $Q$ in the category of locally ringed spaces always exists, and a scheme $Y$ is the scheme-colimit of $F$ iff there is a map $Q\to Y$ that is ""initial among maps to schemes"", i.e. any other map from $Q$ to a scheme factors through it.</p>

<p>Thus the problem of when colimits of schemes exists can be answered if we know when a locally ringed space admits a ""schemification"".</p>

<p><b>Examples:</b> </p>

<p>1) The process of turning a classical variety $V$ into a ""variety with generic points"" $V^s$  is a schemification.  Proving this boils down the classical affine case.  If $R$ is a finite-type reduced $k=\overline{k}$-algebra, and we map $V=mSpec(R)$ to a scheme $Y$, first cover $Y$ by affines $Spec(B_i)$, and then pull back this cover to $V$ and refine it by principal opens $mSpec(R_{f_{ij}})$, so we have maps $B_i \to R_{f_{ij}}$ that determine the map $V\to Y$ (by the adjunction of $Spec({\cal O}(-))$ to the inclusion $AffSch\hookrightarrow LRS)$.  But these define the desired map $V^s\to Y$ because $V^s$ can be obtained by gluing $Spec(R_{f_{ij}})$.</p>

<p>2) For $k=\overline{k}$, if we let $\mathbb{G_m}=\mathbb{A}^1_k\setminus 0$ act on $\mathbb{A}^1_k$, then the coequalizer in schemes of the action and the projection $G_m \times_k \mathbb{A}^1_k \rightrightarrows \mathbb{A}^1_k$ (i.e. the ""categorical quotient"") is $Spec(k)$, hence the locally ringed space coequalizer $Q$, which has two points and is not a scheme, has $Spec(k)$ as its schemification.</p>

<p>3) Some locally ringed spaces have no schemification; for example, two affine lines glued along their generic points.   This is precisely because the gluing diagram has no coequalizer in schemes, as per BCnrd and Anton Geraschenko's <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/9961/colimits-of-schemes/23966#23966"">answer here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When does a locally ringed space $X$ admit a ""schemification"", i.e. a map to a scheme $X^s$ through which any other map to a scheme must factor?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>EDIT:</b> (Response to Martin's answer)</p>

<p>4) Any locally ringed space $X$ with exactly one closed point $x$ has its ""affinization"", $X^a:=Spec({\cal O}_X(X))$, as a schemification.  This is because in a map $F:X\to Y$ with $Y$ a scheme, every point maps to a generization of $f(x)$, so and since open sets are closed under generization, $f$ factors through an affine neighborhood of $f(x)$.  But any map from $X$ to an affine factors uniquely through $X^a$, so we're done.  </p>

<p>5) Schemification commutes with disjoint unions, in that if $X= \coprod X_i$ then $X^s$ exists iff all $X_i^s$ exist, and in that case $X^s = \coprod X_i^s$. So <em>if $X$ is locally connected</em>, since it then decomposes into a disjoint union of connected clopen components, we might as well assume it is connected.</p>

Given two morphisms $f\colon A\to B$ and $g\colon B\to C$, I can tensor them to get a morphism
$$f\otimes g\colon A\otimes B\to B\otimes C.$$
I can then apply $\sigma$ to swap $B$ and $C$ in the codomain, and subsequently apply the trace to obtain some morphism

<p>Suppose you have yourself a quasicategory (or $\infty$-category, or weak kan complex, whatever you call it). Is it always possible to embed this into a finitely bicomplete, pointed quasicategory?

An existence statement would be nice, a construction or reference to an instruction would be even nicer.</p>

<p>A bit more down to earth: Can this even be done with small categories? If you have a small category, can you always add objects to it in some way to make it finitely bicomplete?

"<p>Localizations are an extremely important part of modern homotopy theory.  Both the category of spaces an spectra have a plethora of interesting localizations: at a fixed prime, rational, with respect to a given homology theory, etc.</p>

<p>I started wondering if it's possible to create ""toy models"" of some kind where the collection of possible localizations is somehow under control in a nice way.  This would seem very difficult to accomplish using model categories, since a major theme of the model category literature is that there are almost always lots of localizations around.  It's possible one could do something with $\infty$-categories, since the notion of localization makes sense there as well, but for now I'll just stick to ordinary categories for simplicity.  In fact, localizations are just special reflective subcategories, so let's just think about those.</p>

<p>So suppose I have a category $\mathcal C$.  Can I always find a new category which has $\mathcal C$ as a (proper, so that this is nontrivial) reflective subcategory?  Yes, though I'm not very happy with my solution.  Let $\mathcal C_0$ be the set of objects of $\mathcal C$ regarded as a discrete category.  The inclusion $\mathcal C_0 \rightarrow \mathcal C$ is a diagram in $\mathcal Cat$, and it's easy to see that the Grothendieck construction on this diagram has $\mathcal C$ as a reflective subcategory, albeit in a rather trivial way.  Are there other (possibly better) examples?</p>

<p>Now what if I have a collection of categories $\mathcal C_i$ for $i \in \mathcal I$.  Is it possible to build a new category which contains each of the $\mathcal C_i$ as a reflective subcategory?  </p>

<p>In general are there constructions which affect the collection of reflective subcategories in predictable ways?  For example, it's easy to see that in the disjoint union $\mathcal C \coprod \mathcal D$ of two categories, the collection of reflective subcategories is just the product of those of $\mathcal C$ and those of $\mathcal D$.  The cartesian product $\mathcal C \times \mathcal D$ seems a bit harder to understand.</p>

"<p>I am not really familiar with homotopical category theory, so please forgive me if I make rude mistakes. I know quite a bit of common category theory, as well as familiar with algebraic topology.</p>

<p>How can one construct exact sequences abstractly in the framework of homotopical categories? Consider any model you like (topologically or simplicially enriched, or $(\infty,1)$-categories). <a href=""http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/fiber+sequence"" rel=""nofollow"">nLab</a> teaches us that to construct exact sequences in topology one needs to consider fiber sequences and homotopy limits/colimits. A fiber sequence $F\to E \to B$ is a homotopy pullback</p>

<p>\begin{array}{ccc} F &amp; \rightarrow &amp; E\\\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow\\\
\ast &amp; \rightarrow &amp; B\\\
\end{array}</p>

<p>The loop space $\Omega X$ of $X$ is defined as a homotopy pullback </p>

<p>\begin{array}{ccc} \Omega X &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \ast \\\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow\\\
\ast &amp; \rightarrow &amp; X\\\
\end{array}</p>

<p>Dually, one can define cofiber sequences and suspensions $\Sigma X$. We get a standard adjunction $\Sigma \vdash \Omega$. Given a fiber sequence, one can have a long fiber sequence $\dots\to\Omega E \to \Omega B \to F \to E \to B$. To begin with, consider a homotopy pullback rectangle</p>

<p>\begin{array}{ccc} \Omega B &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \ast \\\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow\\\
F &amp; \rightarrow &amp; E\\\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow\\\
\ast &amp; \rightarrow &amp; B\\\
\end{array}</p>

<p>Standard diagram chasing and (homotopic) universality arguments show that we get a fiber sequence $\Omega  \to F \to E$ etc. Now if we apply the functor $\pi_0 \simeq \pi(\ast,-)$, we get a sequence $$\dots \to \pi_0(\Omega E) \to \pi_0(\Omega B) \to \pi_0(F) \to \dots$$</p>

<p>Using the fact that $\pi_0$ preserves fiber sequences (because it is representable) and $\pi_0(\Omega^i X) \simeq \pi_i (X)$ we get a classical long exact sequence of homotopy groups for a fibration.</p>

<p>Now things get trickier if we consider homotopy pushouts instead of pullbacks. If we have a cover $(U,V)$ of space $X$, then we have a homotopy pushout diagram</p>

<p>\begin{array}{ccc} U\cap V &amp; \rightarrow &amp; U \\\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow\\\
V &amp; \rightarrow &amp; X\\\
\end{array}</p>

<p>Standard arguments allow to replace this diagram with cofiber sequence $U \vee V \to X \to \Sigma (U\cap V)$. In theory it should give Seifert-van Kampen theorem and Mayer-Vietoris sequences in homology and cohomology in a similar way. In practice, I don't understand how can this happen. To get Seifert-van Kampen theorem, one should apply $\pi_1\simeq \pi_0 \circ \Omega$, but $\Omega$ fails to preserve cofiber sequences. Dold-Thom theorem tells us that $H_i = \pi_i \circ S$, where $S$ is the topological abelianization functor. We're fine with $S$, because it's a left adjoint to forgetful functor, but we have the same problem with $\pi_i$. It doesn't preserve cofiber sequences. Even if it did, we would have terms like $\pi_i (S \Sigma X)=H_i (\Sigma X) = H_{i-1}(X)$ for $i&gt;0$, and that is nothing like an ascending sequence of homology groups. Even cohomology isn't fine: we can take the space of maps to $K(\mathbb{Z},1)$ and it turns cofiber sequences into fiber sequences, but we still have a problem with grading, like in case of homology.</p>

<p>So my question is: how can we deal with these difficulties and get the mentioned theorems? I didn't have any success till now in finding references on homotopy limits/colimits technique, although many sources mention them and deal with technical properties, like their existence in model categories. Any references would be greatly appreciated!</p>

"<p>I'm completing a paper about (Mitchell's) semicats (well, not exactly, but let's say so for simplicity), and as a motivational example I'd like to mention at some point that the monic/epic morphisms of the semicat of real/complex normed spaces and (linear) compact operators between them (with the obvious source and target maps and the equally obvious composition) are exactly those that one is expected to get. So my question is:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Is there anything in the literature taking the point of view of semicats in the study of compact operators, in such a way that I can cite it (at least for the sake of comparison)?  </p>

<p><strong>Added later.</strong> [1] Loosely speaking, a semicat is a not-necessarily-unital category. For what it is worth, and to the best of my knowledge, the notion was first introduced by B. Mitchell in <em>The dominion of Isbell,</em> TAMS, Vol. 167 (1972), 319-331. [2] Monic and epic arrows in a semicat are defined in the very same way as monic and epic arrows in categories.

That is, there is a functor $\pi : \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{I}$ which is a fibration of categories.  (One way to say this, I guess, is that $\mathcal{C}$ has a factorization system consisting of vertical arrows, i.e. the ones that $\pi$ sends to an identity arrow in $\mathcal{I}$, and horizontal arrows, which are the ones it does not.

This is a follow-up to <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/137640/shape-of-axioms-in-abstract-algebra"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>I want to study varieties of objects generalizing ordered monoids, in particular using an explicit operator $\omega$, subject to the axiom $(A)$ $xx=x\implies x^\omega=x$, i.e. the restriction of $\omega$ to idempotents has to be the identity function.</p>

<p>Does it make sense to talk about a free algebra in such a context? The problem is that this free algebra would be the same as the one where we don't specify axiom $(A)$, and replace it by axioms $(A')$ like $x^\omega=x^\omega x^\omega$ and $(x^\omega)^\omega=x^\omega$.</p>

<p>If two algebraic structures have exactly the same free object, it seems like this object does not really represent the constraints given by the axioms, and therefore the axioms are not of a shape that allows to define a free object. Is this reasoning valid? </p>

<p>For now, the approach taken is to use axioms $(A')$, and to later use a profinite equation $x^\omega=x^\pi$, where $\pi$ is the profinite idempotent power, in order to define the pseudovariety of objects we are really interested in. But I'm wondering if such a detour is necessary.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>More detailed question:
If we were to use axiom (A), what is needed to be proved in order to show that there is a free object? It seems that closure under arbitrary product is important, why is it the case?
Also, if we just want the universality property for finite objects, then is it enough to prove closure under finite products? Also, isn't enough to take as free object the set of terms quotiented by the axioms, and directly show that it has the universal property?</p>

<p>The usual notion of an adjunction between two 2-categories C and D is a pair of 2-functors F : C &rarr; D and G : D &rarr; C together with a suitably natural equivalence between the categories Hom<sub>D</sub>(FX, Y) and Hom<sub>C</sub>(X, GY).

<li>2-morphisms are bibundle homomorphisms.</li>

<li>1-morphisms are cocontinuous VECT-enriched functors;</li>
<li>2-morphisms are VECT-enriched natural transformations.</li>

<p>In one direction, the functor takes an algebra to its full category of modules.  In the other direction, there might be extra adjectives needed, and I mean to appeal to the Mitchell embedding theorem; but I'm pretty sure an equivalence exists if I insist that every object on the far right comes with a cocontinuous faithful VECT-enriched functor to VECT, and my idea is that Mitchell says that every category admits such a functor.</p>

<p>So anyway, the point is that either category on the right or far right is a sort of ""algebraic"" category, as opposed to the more ""geometric"" category on the left.)</p>

<p>The relationship is something like the following.  To each (locally compact Hausdorff) topological, say, groupoid, we can associate a C-star, say, algebra &mdash; the construction restricts in various special cases to: a (locally compact Hausdorff) topological space $X$ going to its algebra of continuous vanishing-at-infinity functions $C_0(X)$; a finite group $G$ going to its group ring $\mathbb C G$; etc.  The construction extends to 1- and 2-morphisms to build a (contra)functor.  At least if I get all the adjectives right, the functor should be a two-equivalence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong> What's the precisification of what I have said above?  What exactly is the two-functor from groupoids to algebras, and which adjectives make it into an equivalence of two-categories?  Groupoids have natural ""disjoint union"" and ""product"" constructions; these presumably correspond to Cartesian product and tensor product (?!? that's not the coproduct in the category of algebras, but maybe in this two-category it is?) on the algebraic side?</p>

<p>Let me end with an example to illustrate my confusion, which I brought up in <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/27375/"">Op. cit.</a>.  Let $G$ be a finite abelian group; then it has a Pontryagin dual $\hat G$.  Now, there is a canonical way to think of $G$ as a groupoid: it is the groupoid $\{\text{pt}\}//G$ with only one object and with $G$ many morphisms.  If I'm not mistaken, the corresponding algebra should be the group algebra $\mathbb C G$.  But $\mathbb C G$ is also the algebra $C_0[\hat G]$ of functions on the <em>space</em> $\hat G$.  And if there is one thing I am certain of, it is that the underlying space of $\hat G$ (a groupoid with no non-identity morphisms) and the one-object groupoid $\{\text{pt}\}//G$ are not equivalent as groupoids.  And yet their ""function algebras"" are the same.  So clearly I am confused.</p>

"<p>In “Arbib, Manes. Arrows, Structures and Functors. The Categorical Imperative. 6. Structured sets.” there is an approach to formalize structures. I have a strong feeling that they describe just concrete categories in other words. For a concrete category $(C, U)$, the <strong>set of structures on a set</strong> $X$ (this is Arbib, Manes's term) is $(fr\\_ob(U))^{-1}(X)$ where $fr\\_ob(U)$ is a mapping of $U$ on objects. Similarly, the set of <strong>admissible functions</strong> $A\to B$ (for $A\ B\in ob(C)$) is $im(fr\\_hom(U)(A, B))$ where $fr\\_hom(U)$ is a mapping of $U$ on morphisms.</p>

"<h3>Background</h3>

<p>One of my favourite elementary results in group theory is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goursat%27s_lemma"">Goursat's Lemma</a>.  This lemma characterises the subgroups of a direct product of groups in terms of fibred products.</p>

<p>Indeed, let $L$ and $R$ be groups and let $G &lt; L \times R$ be a subgroup of their direct product.  We have natural projections $\pi_L : L \times R \to L$ and $\pi_R: L \times R \to R$.  We may assume without loss of generality that $\pi_L$ and $\pi_R$ are surjective when restricted to $G$.  Let $L_0 = \pi_L(G \cap \ker\pi_R)$ and $R_0 = \pi_R(G \cap \ker\pi_L)$ denote, respectively, normal subgroups of $L$ and $R$.  Goursat's Lemma is the observation that $G$ defines an isomorphism $L/L_0 \cong R/R_0$.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>:  If $x \in L$, let $y \in R$ be such that $(x,y) \in G$.  Such a $y$ exists because of surjectivity of $\pi_L : G \to L$, but it need not be unique.  Nevertheless the coset $y R_0$ is well defined.  This procedure then defines a homomorphism $L \to R/R_0$ whose kernel is precisely $L_0$ and which is surjective because $\pi_R : G \to R$ is.</p>

<p>If we let $\lambda: L/L_0 \to F$ and $\rho: R/R_0 \to F$ be isomorphisms to the same abstract group $F$, then we may identify $G$ with the fibred product
$$ G = \lbrace (x,y) \in L \times R ~|~ \lambda(x L_0) = \rho(y R_0) \rbrace .$$</p>

<p>There are similar results for Lie subalgebras of a direct sum of Lie algebras, and probably also in other categories.  This suggests the following categorical slogan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""subobjects of a product are pullbacks""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Well, at least subobjects with the property that the composition with the epis in the product are also epis.)</p>

<p>Of course, this is not going to be true in all categories, which prompts the following question.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category and $L,R$ be objects whose product $L \times R$ exists.  Let $G \to L \times R$ be a monomorphism such that the compositions $G \to L \times R \to L$ and $G \to L \times R \to R$ are epimorphisms.</p>

<p>What must we demand of $\mathcal{C}$ so that there exist epimorphisms $L \to F$ and $R \to F$ such that
$$\begin{matrix} G &amp; \rightarrow &amp; L \cr
                 \downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow \cr

"<p>I am interested in cohomological functors from a certain small triangulated category $C$ to abelian groups.</p>

<p>The question is: given a tranformation $F\to G$ of two functors of this sort, is it possible to extend it to a long exact sequence $\dots \to H\circ[1]\to F\to G\to H\to F\circ [-1]\to G\circ[-1]\to \dots$?  Here $H$ should be cohomological also, and a sequence is called exact if it is exact when applied to any object of $C$.</p>

<p>Note that in the case where $C$ is a ""countable"" subcategory of compact objects in a certain triangulated $C'$ that is closed with respect to coproducts one has the Neeman's Brown representability for homology property (for $C\subset C'$; see the corresponding Neeman's papers); thus $F$ and $G$ are representable and any transformation between them can be lifted to a $C'$-morphism. Hence one can just take $H$ represented by a cone of (any possible) morphism of this sort. </p>

<p>Yet it does not seem that constructing cones in the ""uncountable"" case is hopeless. Did anybody study related problems before? Any hints would be very welcome!</p>

"<p>A groupoid is a category in which all morphisms are invertible.(*) The groupoids form a very nice subclass of categories. The inclusion of the groupoids into the 2-category of small categories admits both left and right (weak) adjoints. So you can localize (or <em>complete</em>) a category to a groupoid. If E denotes the free walking isomorphism, then the groupoids are precisely the categories which are local with respect to the inclusion of the free walking arrow (let's denote this as [1]) into E. </p>

<p>I have been thinking a lot recently about a certain very nice class of categories, which in many ways is the antithesis of the groupoids. These are the categories X, such that a morphism is an isomorphism in X if and only if it is an identity. Let us call these categories <em>lean</em>.(**) These too form a nice class of categories. The inclusion admits a left adjoint, and the lean categories are precisely those categories which are local for the projection from [1] to the terminal category pt. </p>

<p>What is this left adjoint? (We'll denote it as L). It forms a certain quotient category. You can see it explicitly by taking your given category and forming the quotient where you identify all isomorphisms with identities. </p>

<p>In some cases it is easy to work out what you get. For example if you have a groupoid X and you apply L, you get a discrete category (set) consisting of the components of X. </p>

<p>More generally you have to be more careful. Quotienting out by just the isomorphisms is not compatible with the composition in your category, and so the result is not a category. To get the actual categorical quotient you have to quotient by additional things: compositional  consequences of the initial equivalence relation. </p>

<p>For example suppose that f,g,h are morphisms in your category X, where g  and fgh are isomorphisms. Then for any lean category Y and any functor $X \to Y$, both g and fgh must map to identities in Y. Hence the composite fh must also map to an identity, even if it is not an isomorphism of X. It is not hard to construct an example where this happens. Nevertheless we can ask the following </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question</strong>: Suppose that X is a category such that the lean quotient L(X) is a set (discrete category). Is X necessarily a groupoid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If true, I think this would give a very neat characterization of the groupoids.  I have so far been unable to prove this result or come up with a counter example, but I feel I have been staring at the problem too long. It is enough to prove just the case that L(X) is just a single point. The above discussion shows that in general the quotient $X \to L(X)$ identifies things which are not isomorphisms, which suggests the answer is negative. A positive answer would have to somehow make use of the fact that <em>everything</em> is being identified. </p>

"<p>In Jacob Lurie's classification of tqfts, one finds a version of the cobordism hypothesis for $(X,\zeta)$-structure, where an $(X,\zeta)$ structure on a manifold $M$ is the datum of a continuous map $f:M\to X$ and of an isomorphism $\alpha$ of $\mathbb{R}$-vector bundles $T_M\oplus \mathbb{R}^{n-\dim(M)}\simeq f^*\zeta$. Here $\zeta$ is a fixed rank $n$ vector bundle on $X$ and $\dim(M)\leq n$. This version of the cobordism hypothesis states that for any symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathcal{C}$ with duals there is an equivalence of $(\infty,0)$ categories
$Fun^\otimes(Bord_n^{(X,\zeta)},\mathcal{C}) \simeq Hom_{O(n)}(\tilde{X},\mathcal{C}^{\sim})$, where $\tilde{X}$ is the total space of the principal $O(n)$-bundle on $X$ associated with the vector bundle $\zeta$ and $\mathcal{C}^{\sim}$ is the $(\infty,0)$ category obtained from $\mathcal{C}$ by discarding all the noninvertible morphisms.</p>

<p>In particular, this says (if I'm not wrong here) that given an $O(n)$-equivariant $\mathcal{C}$-valued local system $E$ on $\tilde{X}$ (i.e., an element $E$ in $Hom_{O(n)}(\tilde{X},\mathcal{C}^{\sim})$), to any manifold $M$ of dimension less or equal to $M$ equipped with an $(X,\zeta)$-structure is canonically associated an element $Z(E;M;f,\alpha)$ in $\Omega^{\dim M}\mathcal{C}$.</p>

<p>Now, fix an $n$-dimensional closed manifold $M$ and let $(X,\zeta)=(M,T_M)$. Then $M$ has a canonical $(X,\zeta)$-structure: the one given by the identity morphism! So the above general result on the cobordism hypothesis would say that to any  $O(n)$-equivariant $\mathcal{C}$-valued local system $E$ on $\tilde{M}$ is canonically associated an element in $\Omega^n\mathcal{C}$, which I guess one should think of as the $n$-dimensional holonomy of the given local system. In other words, one should have a canonical morphism</p>

<p>$hol_M: Hom_{O(n)}(\tilde{M},\mathcal{C}^{\sim}) \to \Omega^n \mathcal{C}$.</p>

<p>More in general, if $\dim M\leq n$, one can take $(X,\zeta)=(M,T_M\oplus\mathbb{R}^{n-\dim M})$ and again the identity morphism provides a canonical $(X,\zeta)$-structure on $M$. Thus one should have a canonical morphism </p>
