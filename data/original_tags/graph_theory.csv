"<p>You are in a directed weighted graph with $N$ $(63 \le N \le 10^6)$ vertices and $M$ $(1 \le N \le 10^6)$ edges and you want to get from $63^{rd}$ to $4^{th}$ vertex. Going through $i^{th}$ edge takes you $t_i$ hours $(1 \le t_i \le 24)$. A big monster wants to kill you. He appears in the $i^{th}$ edge $f_i$ times per 24 hours randomly. What is the lowest expected value of you meeting with monster?</p>

<p>Input: In the first line we've got $N$ and $M$. In the $M$ following lines there are descriptions of the edges. In each line there is 4 numbers - $a_i, b_i, t_i, f_i$. It means that $i^{th}$ edge is directed from $a_i$ to $b_i$.</p>

<p>Output: You should give one number. The lowest possible expected value of you meeting with monster.</p>

"<p>I need to a way to express a change in the structure of a given graph <code>G</code>, such that the original graph is <code>G</code> and the changed graph is <code>G'</code>. A change in the graph can be the addition or removal of any number of vertices and/or edges.</p>

<p>Currently, my thought is to express the change as two percentages: the number of vertices in <code>G'</code> as a percentage of the number of vertices in <code>G</code>, and the same for edges. However, it occurs to me that removing a vertex also means removing all edges connected to it.</p>

<p>Are there any standard ways of quantifying the change in a graphs structure?</p>

"<p>Define the Revision Tracking Graph (RTG), which is an oriented graph (without circles) where each node x has a set C(x) associated with it, which contains all edges leading into it on all paths from a node 0 (node with empty set). Each edge can be in a set exactly once!</p>

<p>You can also describe this data structure by the rules for its growth:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with node 0 with associated empty set <code>C(0) = {}</code></li>
<li>For any node x create a new node y where (x,y) is oriented edge from x to y and 
<code>C(y) = C(x) union { (x,y) }</code></li>
<li>For any nodes f and t, create node r, where (f,r) and (t,r) are oriented edges and 
<code>C(r) = C(f) union C(t) union { (f,r), (t,r) }</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Those rules can be described by words as 1) creating new object 2) branching and versioning 3) merging. You can see that the only difference between branching and versioning is whether there already is an edge leading from a node or not. </p>

<p>You can further differentiate the graph by naming branches (paths in the graph).</p>

<p>Base node is defined as a node b, such as <code>C(b) = C(f) intersect C(t)</code>. For short: <code>Result=(From-Base)+To</code>. In other words, if you remove all edges in C(b) from C(f) and add edges from C(t), the resulting set would have every edge exactly once and all edges from C(f) and C(t) would be present in C(r).</p>

<p>I have actually several questions pertaining to this data structure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Prove there are no circles in the graph</li>
  <li>Prove that for certain graphs there are such nodes F,T for which base cannot be found as specified in simple equation.</li>
  <li>Prove that for each graph and each pair of nodes F and T, there is a set of n pairs of nodes Fi,Bi where Fn = F and <code>R = T + Sum(i=1..n) of (Fi-Bi)</code>.</li>
  <li>Create algorithm to find B in simple case where n = 1.</li>
  <li>Create algorithm to find Fi,Bi for i=1..n where n > 1.</li>

"<p>I have a research question that involves human subjects being sorted into groups before playing a social game. </p>

<p>Before sorting, each person decides on their preferred group size, from 1 to n; where n is the total number of players.</p>

<p>I want to be able to sort people into groups of their preferred size, allowing a given level of tolerance for being in a group size that differs from the preferred group size. </p>

<p>For example, in the simplest case we allow no tolerance.
Consider the set of group size preferences for a population of 25 players</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>G = [1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will result in the following sorting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Group a: [ 1 ]</p>
  
  <p>Group b: [ 1 ] </p>
  
  <p>Group c: [ 1 ]</p>
  
  <p>Group d: [ 1 ]</p>
  
  <p>Group e: [ 2 2 ]</p>
  
  <p>Group f: [ 3 3 3 ]</p>
  
  <p>Group g: [ 3 3 3 ]</p>
  
  <p>Group h: [ 4 4 4 4 ]</p>
  
  <p>and the group of remainders: [ 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 5 ].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note how group size equals group size preference and the remainders are all those individuals that could not be put into a group of preferred size.</p>

<p>I want to be able to extend this by allowing some level of tolerance in acceptable group size compared to the preference. For instance, an individual that prefers to be in a group of 3, with tolerance of 1, would be willing to be in any group of size 2-4, but would otherwise be a remainder. However, being in a group of preferred size should have more weight than being assigned to a different group.</p>

<p>Can this problem be solved to minimise:
a.) the number of individuals that are left as a remainder
b.) the number of people that are put into groups different to their preference
c.) the level of tolerance?</p>

<p>Even pointing to similar problems would be much appreciated. </p>

Consider a semi-random network of $N$ nodes $i$ and $M$ connections, the structure of the network does not really matter here. Now I have defined the degree $k$ of a node $i$ as

    k_i=\sum\limits_j A_{ij}

$$
H=\frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_i \sum\limits_{k_i&gt;k_h} i

But I don't think this gives me the right answer, since say that node 10 and 11 are hub nodes, the answer would be $21/N$ instead of $2/N$. I feel like I'm very close, but I can't see it. How should I state it?</p>

I'd like to point out i'm interested in the random algorithmic aspects of the notes and have never studied Boolean functions before.</p>

<p>Claim 5.4: Almost all $n$-input Boolean functions require circuits of size at least $2^{n}/n$</p>

<p>The proof goes as follows: </p>

<p>Proof: (sketch) Let $N(S)$ be the number of circuits of size $S$. To bound $N(S)$, note that each gate has two
possible inputs and $16$ functions, so there are $16\times S^{2}$
choices for a single gate, so the number of circuits is
$N(S) \leq (16 ∗ S^{2})^{S}$. There are $2^{2^{n}}$
different functions with $n$ inputs. A calculation shows that if $S &lt; 2
^{n}/n$,
then $N(S)/2^{2^{n}} \rightarrow 0$
as $n \rightarrow \infty$.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>1) (NOT REGARDING PROOF) Firstly they mention briefly what a gate is but can every boolean function be represented using a series of gates? On page 6 they seem to mention a boolean function has $n$ inputs ($x_{1},...,x_{n}$) and $1$ output, and then just jump to a notion of a gate without really linking them together.  </p>

<p>2) (REGARDING PROOF) I understand since each gate has two inputs for example $x_{2},x_{5}$ and $|\{0,1\}^{2}|=4$ each of these pairs can be assigned two values $0$ or $1$ and so there are 16 possible functions. How did they get $16 \times S^{2}$ possible choices for each gate and more importantly what do they mean here by choice?</p>

<p>3) (REGARDING PROOF) How does the deduction that if $S&lt;2^{n}/n$ then then $N(S)/2^{2^{n}} \rightarrow 0$
as $n \rightarrow \infty$ complete the proof?</p>

"<p>Consider directed graph which has $N + 2$ layers numbered from left to right by integers from $0$ up to $N + 1$.</p>

<p>The leftmost ($0$) and the rightmost ($N + 1$) layers both contain only one vertex while every other layer contains exactly $M$ vertices. Vertices are numbered independently in each layer by integers from 0 to M - 1. For each pair of vertices which are in the adjacent layers ($i$ and $i + 1$ for any $i$ ($0 &lt;= i &lt;= n$)), there exists an edge. The vertex which is in the layer with smaller number is the initial vertex for such edge and the other one is the terminal vertex.</p>

<p>So the graph initially is something like this :</p>

<p>Let us assume N = 4  And M=3 </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/sGvod.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here A node is in layer 0 and N th node is in layer N+1 that is 5</p>

<pre><code>Layer 1 has nodes = {B,C,D}
Layer 2 has nodes = {E,F,G}
Layer 3 has nodes = {H,I,J}
Layer 4 has nodes = {K,L,M}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we know that number of paths to go from A(that is first layer) to N(that is last layer) is $M^N$</p>

<p>Now suppose we add K more edges. Each edge connects two vertices which are in the different layers, no matter the adjacent layers or not. Also, each edge is directed from left to right (as well as all previously existing edges).</p>

<p>Like say we add an edge between Layer 1 Node 3 that is D to Layer 3 Node 3 that is J then graph look like this :</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/1RmFA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>How many ways are there to reach from leftmost layer(0) to the rightmost layer(N+1) after adding these K edges ?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Note : Two paths are considered different if there is, at least, one edge which belongs to exactly one path. However, we are allowed to traverse the same set of vertices. In that case, there should be a multiple edge in the graph. It is also possible if some edge added connects two adjacent layers.</strong></p>

<p>For example : It can also be like this :</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/FroCw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In this case both edges are considered as different . So we need to count these total ways.</p>

<p>My Attempt : I know that if suppose we add a single edge between layers at A from start and B from end then it introduces M^(A-1)*M^(N-B) new paths. But problem arise when their are other edges added after that edge.</p>

<p>Example : Let N=4 , M=2 and K=2</p>

<p>There are 16 ways to get from the layer #0 to the layer #5. Now we have added edges. </p>

<p>Let first edge added is between (Layer 2,Node 1) to (Layer 5,Node 0) then there are 2 ways to get from the layer #0 to the layer #5 using this edge (0, 0 -> 1, 0 -> 2, 1 -> 5, 0 and 0, 0 -> 1, 1 -> 2, 1 -> 5, 0) </p>

<p>Let second edge added is between (Layer 0,Node 0) to (Layer 4,Node 0) then there is 1 way to get from the layer #0 to the layer #5 using this edge (0, 0 -> 4, 0 -> 5, 0)</p>

<p>So total is 16+2+1=19 ways</p>

<p><strong>Edit :</strong> To make question precise we can assume that we are given N , M and K </p>

<p>Also then we are given K extra edges. Each edge is of form Layer1 , Node1 , Layer2 , Node 2 which shows that a edge between Node 1 of Layer 1 is directed toward Layer 2 Node 2.</p>

<p>How many paths are their now to reach last layer from starting layer ?</p>

  <p>It is understood that wherever any lines meet or intersect, there will be a connector so we don't have to worry about even/odd rules, overlapping or partially-enclosed polygons, etc. as they don't apply.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, we're trying to identify all of the created polygons (the colored shapes in the right image.)  I believe this can be completed in two steps.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3AENJ.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3AENJ.png"" alt=""Polygons""></a></p>

<p><strong>Part 1: Removing superfluous items</strong></p>

<p>Stand-alone connectors (connector 'A' here) can simply be removed since they can't be part of a shape's outline.</p>

<p>Floating end-points referencing a single segment (connectors 'B' and 'E') can also be removed as they too can't be part of a shape's outline.  This will also remove their referenced segments (B-C and E-D).</p>

<p>Performing the above recursively will next identify 'C' as an endpoint (since 'B' and B-C were already removed) so it and it's remaining segment C-D can also be removed.  On the next recursive pass, connector 'D' and segment D-F will also be removed, etc.</p>

<p>However, I haven't found a good way to identify segment G-H. That said, I think that can be achieved during polygon detection since such segments would only be the result of compound paths and would be traced in both directions during one shape's detection. (More on that below.)</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Polygon Detection</strong></p>

<p>Each segment can be traced in two directions. For instance, the segment connecting 'O' and 'P' can be either O-P or P-O.  Picking a trace-direction of clockwise, O-P would belong to the polygon O-P-Q-N whereas P-O would belong to the polygon P-O-I.</p>

<p>The following logic assumes a trace-direction of clockwise.</p>

<p>Starting from any segment, when tracing around, if you get back to your starting point, you have identified a potential polygon.  By keeping a running delta of your heading's angle as you trace around (this is how much your heading turns and is not to be confused with simply adding the angles between segments), when done, if that angle is positive, you've detected a valid polygon.  If it's negative, you've detected a 'containing' polygon, meaning one that contains one or more 'valid' polygons.  The outer perimeter of the entire shape (or shapes) are all containing polygons.</p>

<p>Consider the case of a square, diagonally divided into two triangles.  Tracing each segment twice--once in each direction--you will end up with three potentially-valid polygons: a square and two triangles.  The triangles will have a positive angle delta telling you they're valid, but the square's angle delta will be negative telling you that's the containing polygon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: A containing polygon can be equal to a valid polygon too. It will just be 'wound' in the opposite direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider a simple triangle.  The clockwise trace will yield the valid polygon.  The second attempt to trace clockwise will actually yield a counter-clockwise trace which will give you a negative angle delta, telling you that's actually the outline of the shape.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: You also have to test for other polygons encountered along the way by also testing each point for any previously-encountered point during that shape detection.  If you find you've revisited the same point, save off the polygon created since the first encounter of that point, check it's angle. If it's positive, it's a valid polygon (and you're actually currently tracing a containing polygon.) If it's negative, you've detected a containing polygon (in which case you're currently tracing a valid polygon.) Finally, remove all segments on your accumulation stack back to the first instance that point was last encountered and continue on with your detection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, if you started at 'J' and traced around counter-clockwise, you would go through 'I', 'H', then 'G', then 'F' then you'd be back at 'H'. You just found a polygon H-G-F which has a negative angle so you know it's a containing polygon. Remove those three segments from your stack and continue on.  Now you'll again hit 'I'.  In this case, you already visited that same segment during this pass, but in the other direction, so simply remove that segment completely from your stack and continue on, next to 'O' then 'N', etc. You'll eventually be back at 'J'.</p>

<p>When a segment has been traced in both directions, it can be considered 'used' and no further processing of that segment is needed. Continue processing all non-used segments.  Once all segments have been traced in both directions, you can be sure all polygons--valid and containing--have been found.</p>

<p>Finally, check each containing polygon to see if it falls within any valid polygon. If so, exclude it from that valid polygon creating a compound path.  In the example here, containing polygon H-G-F is contained by the valid cyan polygon so it should be excluded.  Note there is also a valid H-F-G polygon which is marked in red here.</p>

"<p>Proposition. If $G$ is a bipartite graph with at least one edge, then its spectrum is symmetrical with respect to $0$, i.e. if a number $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $G$ then $- \lambda$ is also an eigenvalue of $G$.</p>

<p>Proof. Let $G \in B(m,n)$. Then $A(G)$ is an $(m+n) \times (m+n)$ matrix. Suppose that $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $G$ and $x=(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{m+n})$ is a corresponding eigenvector. Consider the vector $y=(y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{m+n})$ where $y_{j}=x_{j}$ if $1 \le j \le m$ and $y_{j}=-x_{j}$ if $m+1 \le j \le m+n$. 
Then </p>

<p>$ \sum_{j=1}^{m+n}a_{ij}y_{j}=\sum_{j=m+1}^{m+n}a_{ij}y_{j}=-\sum_{j=m+1}^{m+n}a_{ij}x_{j}=- \lambda x_{i} = -\lambda y_{i}$, if $1 \le i \le m$, 
and $ \sum_{j=1}^{m+n}a_{ij}y_{j}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}y_{j}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}x_{j}=\lambda x_{i} = - \lambda y_{i}$, if $m+1 \le i \le m+n$.</p>

<p>The degrees would have to be the integers 0,1,…,4k+1: why?</p>

<p>This was my solution to it</p>

<p>Given a simple graph with n = 4k + 2 vertices. Can the vertices of
this graph have distinct degrees?</p>

<p>Since n is isomorphic to its complement, we know that graph have
the same number of edges. Also, if we look at the union of the edges of both
graphs we know we get all possible edges. If n has n vertices, there are $n(n-1)\over 2$ possible edges, so n must have exactly half of them. Therefore,</p>

<p>$|E(n)| = |E(n)| =$$n(n-1)\over4$</p>

<p>Now we can see that since |E(n)| must be an integer, 4 must divide evenly
into n or n − 1. So, we conclude that n = 4k + 1 for some nonnegative
integer k.</p>

<p>From this can i conclude that n is isomorphic to its complement and n = 4k + 1 for some nonnegative integer k, then it has distinct degrees.</p>

<p>In a simple graph the edges form a set and each edge is a unordered pair of distinct vertices. In a simple graph with n vertices, the degree of every vertex is at most n − 1. So since the graph would be adjacent to $|x − y| ≡ 0(mod 2)$ it would be simple because it can evenly divide.</p>

<p>Since $K_a$ is connected, it is a tree if and only if \begin{eqnarray*} 0 &amp;=&amp;|E(K_a)| -|V(K_a)| +1 \\

&amp;=&amp; 1/2[a(a-1)-2(a-2)] \\
&amp;=&amp; 1/2[(a-1)(a-2)] =0 \end{eqnarray*}</p>

<p>Thus $K_a$ is a tree if and only if $a-1=0$ or $a-2=0,$ i.e., $a=1$ or $a=2$.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> For all $u,v \in V(K_{a,b})$, $\deg(u) = a$ and $\deg(v) = b $ implies that $$2|E(K_{a,b})| = \sum \deg(u) + \sum \deg(v)= ab+ab=2ab,$$ so $|E(K_{a,b})|=ab.$</p>

<p>Since $K_{a,b}$ is connected, it is a tree if and only if \begin{eqnarray*} 0 &amp;=&amp;|E(K_{a,b})| -|V(K_{a,b})| +1 \\

<p>n Let G be a graph with 4 vertices, one vertex representing each person in the group.
Join two vertices u and v by an edge if and only if u and v are friends. Then the degree of

"<p>Here $G_{n,p}$ represents the Erdős-Rényi random graph model, where the graph has order $n$ and each edge is added independently with probability $p$. I am faced with proving the following claim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Show that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that, for every $p$ we have: </p>
  
  <p>$\mathbb{P}(G_{n,p}$ is disconnected) $\leq c \mathbb{P}(G_{n,p}$ has an isolated vertex).   $\,\,\,(*)$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the appearance of the question I think it is meant to be interpreted as asking ''in the limit $n \to \infty$''. It is clear that $\mathbb{P}($a fixed vertex of $G_{n,p}$ is isolated$)=(1-p)^{n-1}$. It is easy to calculate the expected number of isolated vertices using this, but I'm not convinced that helps.</p>

<p>As a last thought, a followup to the question asks ""What value of $c$ would be acceptable""? It is therefore probably not the case that a valid choice of $c$ will actually be obtained in the proof, although it may be reasonably clear how to calculate one; perhaps that clarifies the nature of the solution a little. Many thanks for your help.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Update - I have thought a little more about it, and I have the following theorem we can hopefully make use of (if anyone is willing to help me!): suppose $p = \frac{\log{n}+\gamma(n)}{n}$ and $\gamma(n)$ grows at most slowly (say $o(\log \log n)$); then </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if $\gamma(n) \to +\infty$, $\mathbb{P}(G_{n,p}$ disconnected)$\to 0$, </p>
  
  <p>if $\gamma(n) \to -\infty$, $\mathbb{P}(G_{n,p}$ disconnected)$\to 1$, </p>
  
  <p>if $\gamma(n) \to k$, $\mathbb{P}(G_{n,p}$ disconnected)$\to 1-e^{-e^{-k}}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now in the first case, being connected implies no isolated vertex, so $(*)$ holds with any constant $c$ since both probabilities are 0. Likewise, in the second case, the graph is almost surely disconnected: while this doesn't immediately imply that an isolated vertex exists, we can hopefully say for $X:=\#$ of isolated vertices,</p>

<p>$\mathbb{E}(X)=n(1-p)^{n-1} = n(1-\frac{\log{n}+\gamma(n)}{n})^{n-1} \sim ne^{-(\log{n}+\gamma(n))} = e^{-\gamma(n)} \to \infty$.</p>

<p>I <strong>think</strong> this last step holds but it may depend on $\gamma$: in general I'm not sure for which functions $(1+\frac{f(n)}{n})^n \to e^{f(n)}$, I know this is true for the log term but maybe not if $\gamma$ grows very fast (though obviously it can't grow any faster than $1-\frac{\log{n}}{n}$ otherwise we would have $p&gt;1$).</p>

<p>We can also calculate the second moment and get $\mathbb{E}(X^2)-\mathbb{E}(X)^2 \sim e^{-\gamma(n)}$ and deduce that with high probability there is an isolated vertex. Thus again, both probabilities are equal and we can take (e.g.) $c=1$. </p>

<p>The <em>hard</em> case is where $\gamma(n) \to k$: in this case we can reapply the same method to get $\mathbb{E}(X) \sim e^{-k}$, a constant. We can calculate again $\mathbb{E}(X^2) -\mathbb{E}(X)^2 \sim e^{-k}$, and use Chebyshev's inequality to calculate $\mathbb{P}(X=0) \leq e^{-k}/e^{-2k} = e^k$. If $k&lt;0$, then this gives us an actual bound on the probability; otherwise we just get $\mathbb{P}(X=0) \leq 1$. </p>

<p>Supposing $k&lt;0$ then; we can rewrite as $s:=\mathbb{P}(X&gt;0)=\mathbb{P}$(isolated vertex)$\geq 1-e^k$, $d:=\mathbb{P}($disconnected) and using the fact $d =1- e^{-e^{-k}}$ and a little rearranging I think we get out the inequality $d \leq 1-\exp\left(\frac{1}{s-1}\right)$. We can then find a $c$ which works by applying the lower bound to $s$ in terms of $k$ then looking at the values of $c$ such that $cx \geq 1-\exp\left(\frac{1}{s-1}\right),\,x \in [1-e^k,1]$. However, this is only for fixed $k$! If we try and do this for <em>every</em> $k&lt;0$ (i.e. every probability of this type) simultaneously, then we find that $c$ must be arbitrarily large. What's worse, this method doesn't work at all for $k \geq 0$ where we don't have a lower bound for $s$: in this case $s$ can be arbitrarily small and we can't pick a $c$ big enough to always work. So close and yet so far. </p>

<p>I am aware this question's length has spiralled out of control, so apologies for that - I know there's a good chance Math.SE is not going to provide me with an answer to this one. Nevertheless, it says add your working and this is what I managed to do! A proof which works for all <em>slowly</em> decreasing $\gamma$ or $\gamma \to k \in (-\infty,-\epsilon],$ any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. </p>

<p>I have a strong suspicion this is not how I was meant to try and tackle the question, but tragically this is the best I could do so far. Thank you in advance to anyone who actually reads through all this!</p>

Let $G$ be a connected, $k$-regular graph, $G\neq K_n$, then $G$ is strongly regular if and only if $|Spec(G)|=3$.</p>

<p>Now I am having trouble with the given proof of the ""$\Leftarrow$"" direction:</p>

<p>Let $k,\beta_1,\beta_2$ be the eigenvalues of $A$. Consider the matrix
    \begin{align*}
		M:=\frac{1}{(k-\beta_1)(k-\beta_2)}(A-\beta_1 I)(A-\beta_2 I),
	\end{align*}
    then $M$ has all of its eigenvalues equal to $0$ or $1$. This is, since if $b_i$ is an eigenvector of $A$ to eigenvalue $\beta_i$, $i=1,2$, with $b_i\perp\mathbb{1}$, then
    \begin{align*}
		M\cdot b_1 =0,\\
		M\cdot b_2 =0,\\
		M\cdot\mathbb{1}=\mathbb{1}.
	\end{align*}
    Therefore $Spec(M)=\{1^{(1)},0^{(n-1)}\}$. Since $G$ is connected and because of the spectrum of $J$ (the $n\times n$ matrix with all 1's entries) as computed as $Spec(J)=\{1^{(1)},0^{(n-1)}\}$, we get $M=\frac{1}{n}\cdot J$. That is
    \begin{align*}
		\frac{1}{n}\cdot J=\frac{1}{(k-\beta_1)(k-\beta_2)}(A-\beta_1 I)(A-\beta_1 I)(A-\beta_2 I).
	\end{align*}
    Factorising this out gives
\begin{align*}
   A^2=k\cdot I+\lambda\cdot A+\mu\cdot(J-I-A),
\end{align*}
which is a characterization of $G$ being strongly regular.</p>

"<p>Let us denote by $\def\Graph{{\sf Graph}}\Graph$ the category of directed graphs
$G$ with multiple edges: they are given by a set $G_v$ of vertices, a set $G_e$ of edges,
and two functions from $G_e$ to $G_v$ determining the target ($\tau$) and the source ($\sigma$)
of every edge. The morphisms are called graph homomorphisms: given graphs
$G$ and $G'$, a graph homomorphism is a pair of functions $h_v\colon G_v \to G'_v$ and
$h_e\colon G_e \to G'_e$ such that the source and the target of every edge are preserved.</p>

<p>NOW,An algebraic theory is a small category $T$ with finite products.
An algebra for the theory $T$ is a functor $A\colon T \to {\sf Set}$ preserving finite products.
We denote by $\def\Alg{\mathop{\rm Alg}}\Alg T$ the category of algebras of $T$. Morphisms, called homomorphisms,

$\tau$, $\sigma$, under products--what graph determines the $A$-image of a word in $\{e,v\}^*$ and a pair $(a, \alpha)$;see below.</p>

<p>Here,free completion under products in a category $C$ can be described as the category of all words over $\mathop{\rm obj} C$ (the
set of objects of $C$); that is, objects have the form of $n$-tuples $c_0\ldots c_{n-1}$,
where each $c_i$ is an object of $C$ (and where $n$ is identified with the set
$\{0,\ldots, n − 1\}$), including the case $n = 0$ (empty word). Morphisms from
$c_0\ldots c_{n-1}$ to $c'_0\ldots c_{k-1}'$ are pairs ($a$, $\alpha$) consisting of a function $a\colon k \to n$
and a $k$-tuple of $C$-morphisms $\alpha = (\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_{k-1})$ with $\alpha_i\colon c_{a(i)} \to  c'_i$.</p>

"<p>This question came from a question asked earlier today linked <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1403945/grouping-kids-in-groups-of-4"">here</a></p>

<p>The question implicitly asked how to make a schedule with his/her class of 24 students such that:
1)  Everyday will consist of the 24 students split into 6 groups of 4 students.
2)  Over the course of several days, every pair of students will have been in a group with one another.</p>

<p>This seems like it might be a Steiner system, but i'm not exactly sure. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_system"" rel=""nofollow"">Steiner system</a> $S(2,4,24)$.
I've found that a necessary condition for this system existing is the existence of $S(1,3,23)$.  Now here's where I'm not sure if I'm following the definition of Steiner system exactly.  This system, $S(1,3,23)$ would be a $K_3$ decomposition of $K_{23}$, would it not?  <strong>Perhaps this is not exactly a Steiner system, this is part of my question.  Help me to clear this up</strong></p>

<p>How many days would be required to schedule this?<br>
Well, we need to partition the edges of $K_{24}$ which has $\binom{24}{2}$ edges.  Each $K_4$ has 6 edges.  So on a single day we would have 36 edges while we need a total of 276 edges.  However, $\frac{276}{36}$ is not an integer, so this actually tells us that <strong>we can't do this if we require no edges to be repeated.</strong>  So, some pairs of students will be in the same group with each-other more than once.</p>

<p><strong>The Question</strong>:  What is the minimum number of days required to schedule this?  Will $\lceil\frac{276}{36}\rceil = 8$ days be sufficient?  What exactly am I dealing with here?  Some sort of design?  A Steiner system?  What?</p>

"<p>In software engineering, there is a coverage metric for testing called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_condition/decision_coverage"" rel=""nofollow"">modified condition/decision coverage</a>, or MC/DC for short. This metric is well-known in the avionics industry due to showing up in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178B"" rel=""nofollow"">DO-178B</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178C"" rel=""nofollow"">DO-178C</a> standards as part of the testing requirements for Level A airborne software.</p>

<p>One way of thinking about MC/DC is in terms of Boolean functions. For an $n$-input Boolean function $f : \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$, MC/DC coverage is achieved if we can show that each of the $n$ input variables of $f$ has an <em>independent effect</em> on the output of $f$. That is, we have to exhibit pairs of input strings $x$ and $y$ such that $f(x) \neq f(y)$ and $x$ and $y$ differ only at a single position $i$. MC/DC coverage is achieved if we can find such pairs of strings for each input position $0 \leq i &lt; n$.</p>

<p>Now, test rig time on avionics hardware is often expensive. Companies have a strong desire to minimize the number of test cases that have to be run on their devices to achieve certification.* Obviously, if it is possible to achieve MC/DC coverage at all on some $n$-input function, then it can be done with $2n$ inputs: simply list all $n$ pairs of inputs individually. However, it is often possible to reuse the same input string to show the effect of multiple input variables. For example, if $f$ is a 4-input AND gate, then we can show the effect of all 4 input variables by evaluating $f$ at just 5 input strings: $\{1111, 0111, 1011, 1101, 1110\}$. This works because the necessary 4 pairs are $[\{1111, 0111\}, \{1111, 1011\}, \{1111, 1101\}, \{1111, 1110\}]$.</p>

<p>This prompts the question in the title: <strong>Is it always possible to get MC/DC coverage on an $n$-input Boolean function with $n + 1$ test cases (assuming that it is possible to get MC/DC coverage at all)?</strong></p>

<p>To state this question more formally, I will use the following definitions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call two $n$-bit strings <em>$i$-adjacent</em> if they have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance"" rel=""nofollow"">Hamming distance</a> $1$, differing only at position $i$ ($0 \leq i &lt; n$).</li>
<li>Call an $n$-input Boolean function $f$ <em>dependent on all of its inputs</em> if for all $0 \leq i &lt; n$ there exist $i$-adjacent strings $x$ and $y$ such that $f(x) \neq f(y)$.</li>
<li>Let $f$ be an $n$-input Boolean function, and let $T$ be a list of $n$ unordered pairs of $n$-bit strings. Then $T$ <em>gets MC/DC coverage</em> on $f$ if for all $0 \leq i &lt; n$, we have $T_i = \{v_1, v_2\}$, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are $i$-adjacent, and $f(v_1) \neq f(v_2)$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then my question is as follows: <strong>For any $n$-input Boolean function $f$ that is dependent on all of its inputs, does there always exist a list $T$ that gets MC/DC coverage on $f$ such that $|\bigcup_{0 \leq i &lt; n} T_i| = n + 1$?</strong></p>

<p>I have tried for a while to construct a counterexample function, but in every case I have found that either I could contrive a set of $n + 1$ test cases that works, or else the function ends up not actually depending on one or more of its input variables. For an example of a simple function that has an $n + 1$ solution that is not immediately obvious, consider the function $f(a, b, c, d) = (a \vee b) \wedge (c \vee d)$. The 5-element set $\{1010, 0010, 0110, 1000, 1001\}$ gets MC/DC coverage on this function, because we have $[\{1010, 0010\}, \{0010, 0110\}, \{1010, 1000\}, \{1000, 1001\}]$.</p>

<p>I have also made some minor efforts to prove the statement using subtrees of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube_graph"" rel=""nofollow"">hypercube graphs</a>, but I feel like my combinatorics background is not strong enough (or I'm missing something obvious). It's easy enough to check all the cases by hand for $n \leq 2$, but for $n \geq 3$ I'm stuck.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have run a computer search with an SMT solver and determined that there are no counterexamples with $n \leq 4$.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Here is a restatement of the problem in terms of hypercube graphs. Let $G$ be the $n$-dimensional hypercube graph, and let $f$ be a vertex coloring of $G$ with two colors (not requiring that adjacent vertices have different colors). Let $G'$ be the subgraph of $G$ obtained by removing any edge whose vertices are both the same color, so that the vertex coloring is proper. Suppose $G'$ contains an edge along each dimension. Then, does there always exist a set of $n + 1$ vertices such that the induced subgraph of $G'$ on these vertices also contains an edge along each dimension?</p>

<p>Also, here is a proof that it is not possible to use <em>fewer</em> than $n + 1$ vertices for any $f$. Suppose that we have a subgraph $H$ of the $n$-dimensional hypercube graph with $n$ edges and $k \leq n$ vertices. Since there are not more vertices than edges, $H$ must contain a cycle. But if $H$ contains a cycle, then it has to contain two edges that are both along the same dimension. Since there are only $n$ edges and at least two of them are along the same dimension, $H$ can't have edges along all $n$ dimensions. Note that this is purely a pigeonhole principle argument; it does not in any way depend upon $f$.</p>

"<p>The concrete example is:</p>

<p>I am given <code>n</code> currencies and pairwise exchange rates, and I have to change say dollars for euros. And I don't have to change money directly, for example, I could change dollars to British pounds first and then to euros and make more money than I would have by direct exchange. So my first idea was to draw complete graph with exchange rates as weights of edges and use Dijkstra's algorithm with a small change, I multiply weight, not sum. Actually it seems to be logical: if I go through a path and each time make appropriate multiplications I get number of units (in currency that corresponds to the node I have come to) I would have after these exchanges. And on each iteration of Dijkstra's algorithm if I see that the way I exchange the money at this step is better than previous one for this node (if visited) then I change the value. So when I finish a tree I can easily find a shortest path between to nodes, i.e. optimal way to exchange money from one currency to all another. Is there something what contradicts this idea?</p>

<a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/126216/inter-causal-reasoning-how-to-solve-probability-with-two-conditions"">Inter-causal reasoning: How to solve probability with two conditions?</a></p>

<p>I'm a beginner in probability, and trying to deeply understand what is happening underneath.</p>

<p>To sum up what the question is about:</p>

<p>We've got a graph of (binary) events:</p>

<p>$$
A \rightarrow C \leftarrow B
$$</p>

<p>We're given probabilities of:
$$
P(A), P(\bar A), P(B), P(\bar B)
\\
P(C|A, B)\\
P(C|A, \bar B)\\
P(C|\bar A, B)\\
P(C|\bar A, \bar B)
$$
Where $P(A)$ is a probability of occurrence of event $A$ and $P(\bar A)$ is a probability of event $A$ not occurring.</p>

<hr>

<p>We have to find probability of: $P(B|C)$ and $P(B|C,A)$.</p>

<p>Before going further I'd like to say, that I'd like to find out a bit more things and, of course, be aware of theorems used.</p>

<p>I'll begin with really simple ones (numbering done to ease answering the questions):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does $P(B|C,A)$ means: <em>Probability that event $B$ will occur given event $A$ and event $C$ occurred</em> ?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the events $A$ and $B$ independent? I see a <em>V-structure</em> in here, so we've got no <em>active trail</em> in here, right? So they're independent.</p></li>
<li><p>We can write (<em>Bayes theorem</em>) that $P(B|C) = \frac{P(C|B)P(B)}{P(C)}$. </p>

<p>3.1. To get $P(C|B)$ can we do conditioning and reduction on $B$ ?</p>

<p>3.1.1. If yes, then does it equals to (why, what is the rule; my intuition says ""B""): 
$$
Option~A\\
P(C|B) = P(C|B,A)+P(C|B,\bar A)\\
\\
Option~B\\
P(C|B) = P(C|B,A)P(A)+P(C|B,\bar A)P(\bar A)
$$</p>

<p>3.1.2. Does the (in)dependence of $A$ and $B$ affects somehow the way we can count $P(C|B)$ ?</p>

<p>3.2. How can we count $P(C)$? Is it:
$$
P(C) = ( P(C|A,B)+ P(C|A, \bar B) ) * ( P(C| \bar A,B) + P(C|\bar A, \bar B) )
$$</p></li>
<li><p>Counting $P(B|C,A)$:</p>

<p>4.1. <strong>I have counted it</strong>, but I cannot recall how, and I don't have my notes in here. It only means, that I didn't understood it, as I cannot do it again ;) I thought I can use a <em>Bayes theorem</em> in here, but will this turn out to be $\frac{P(C,A|B)P(C,A)}{P(B)}$ ? It doesn't look well.. And, can I use somehow the fact of (in)dependence of $A$ and $B$ in here?</p>

<p>4.2. I know there's an answer in the connected question, but it's not about getting the answer. I want to understand how to figure out this answer.</p></li>

The cows in the herd are more or less always moving, at different direction and in different velocities.When a cow bumps another cow it affects its direction and perhaps its speed so that they would not keep brushing up against each other.

"<p>(I have posted the following in theoretical CS stackexchange, but realized that it's the wrong place, so I'm reposting it here)</p>

<p>I'm reading CLRS's (Cormen et.a al) <em>Introduction to Algorithm</em>, and arrived at the maximum flow section. It shows that Edmonds-Karp algorithm runs in $O(E^2V)$ time by showing that:</p>

<p>1) If we let $\delta_f(s, u)$ be the shortest distance from source $s$ to vertex $u$ in the residual graph after flow $f$ is picked, then CLRS shows that $\delta_f(s, u)$ does not decrease as $f$ gets augmented, for a fixed $u$.</p>

<p>2) Let $c_f(e)$ be the capacity of edge $e$, and $c_f(p)$ the capacity of a path $p$ (the minimum of all $c_f$ on the edges in the path $p$) in the residual graph after flow $f$. If we say that an edge $(u, v)$ in a residual network $G_f$ is <em>critical</em> on an augmenting path $p$ if $c_f(p) = c_f(u, v)$, then CLRS shows that each edge can't become critical more than $|V|/2$ times, and therefore, there can be at most $|E||V|$ augmenting flows, if we sum up this bound over all of the potential $2|E|$ edges in residual graphs.</p>

<p>In particular, CLRS's proof of the 2nd point goes as follows:</p>

<p>If $(u, v)$ becomes critical at $f$, then $\delta_f(s, v) = \delta_f(s, u) + 1$, because we have picked the shortest path from $s$ to $t$.</p>

<p>The next time it becomes critical, there must have been some flow $f'$ that ran through $(v, u)$. Then $\delta_{f'}(s, u) = \delta_{f'}(s, v) + 1$. This must mean $\delta_{f'}(s, u) \ge \delta_f(s, u) + 2$. </p>

<p>Hence every time $(u, v)$ becomes critical after the 1st, $\delta_f(s, u)$ must have increased by 2. As this minimal distance can't exceed $|V|$, each edge can become critical at most $|V|/2$ times. Therefore, there can at most be $O(EV)$ augmenting paths and hence the number of augmentations.</p>

<p>So my comment now comes in as a possible improvement over this proof. Why can't we say the following:</p>

<p>If we augment the edge $(u, v)$ $k$ times,then $\delta_f(s, u)$ increases at least by $2(k-1)$. Now instead of looking at edges, we look at vertices and their degrees. We just need to guarantee the edges going out from any particular vertex $v$ become critical infrequently enough so that $\delta(v)$ doesn't exceed $|V|$ (from now on for convenience I will shorten $\delta_f(s, v)$ to $\delta(v)$). I claim that for any vertex $v$, $\sum_{(v,u)\in E \text{ or } (u, v)\in E} \text{number of times $(v, u)$ becomes critical}$ is at most $indegree(v)+outdegree(v)+|V|/2$. (we are looking at ""reverse"" edges here too because they may appear in the residual graph)</p>

<p>Indeed, the first time any edge becomes critical is ""free"": it doesn't bump up $\delta(v)$. But for every time after that $\delta(v)$ goes up by 2. So we can get every edge going out from $v$ to become critical once (this is the $indegree(v)+outdegree(v)$ term) and then all other times are bounded by $|V|/2$ for the same reason CLRS writes. </p>

<p>Now if we sum up this bound for all vertices, we get
$$\sum_v indegree(v)+outdegree(v)+|V|/2 = 2|E| + |V|^2/2 = O(V^2)$$</p>

<p>This bound is better than the $O(EV)$ bound given by CLRS. Combined with the $O(E+V)=O(E)$ bound for BFS, we find Edmonds-Karp is actually $O(EV^2)$ instead of $O(E^2V)$.</p>

<p>I'm suspicious that I'm missing something, since every where I looked, the bound given for Edmonds-Karp is $O(E^2V)$. So please nitpick away and see where I reasoned incorrectly.</p>

The exponential graph $G^H$ has all the functions from vertex-set of $H$ to that of $G$ as vertices and two of these functions $f,g$ are joined by an edge if $[f(u),g(v) ∈ E(G)]$ for all $[u,v] ∈ E(H)$.<br/>

"<p>I'm am trying to define a data structure to represent road networks.  The immediately obvious structure is that of a graph - a set of nodes and edges that connect pairs of nodes.  The nodes would represent things like intersections, and the edges would represent lanes.  </p>

<p>However, the basic concept of a graph is insufficient to describe what I want.  I also want to be able to describe how certain lanes are ""reachable"" or ""adjacent"" to other lanes.  (Imagine parallel lanes with no median between them.  You can just switch lanes.)  This seems to imply a need to have some sort of meta-edge that connects pairs of edges.  Is there any mathematical structure that sounds like this?  Is this reducible to the standard concept of a graph? Thanks.</p>

"<p>This is an extension of the problem at this thread: <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/q/239120/74947"">Graphs, line graph and complement of graph</a>.</p>

<p>Just to reiterate definitions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>line graph</em> $L(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined in the following way: the vertices of $L(G)$ are the edges of $G$, $V(L(G))=E(G)$, and two vertices in $L(G)$ are adjacent if and only if the corresponding edges in $G$ share a vertex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: </p>

<p>Suppose $G$ has $n$ vertices, labeled $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n$ and the degree of vertex $v_i$ is $r_i$. Let $m$ denote the size of $G$, so $r_1+r_2+\ldots+r_n=2m$. Find formulas for the order and size of $L(G)$ in terms of $n,m,$ and $r_i$.</p>

<p><strong>So far</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clearly, the order is $m$.</li>
<li>Suppose that the edge $e=(v_i,v_j)$ exists in $G$. Then, the $\deg(e)=r_i+r_j - 2$ in $L(G)$, because at the $v_i$ end, $e$ shares $v_i$ with $r_i - 1$ other edges, and at the $v_j$ end, $e$ shares $v_j$ with $r_j - 1$ other edges.</li>
<li>I tried to use the above to sum over all the edges in $G$, but this depends on knowing which edges exist in the graph $G$, which we are not given. We only know the <em>degree sequence</em>, not the edges.</li>
<li>Another approach I tried was to find this expression for a regular graph with degree $k$, and this can be found using the above: $$m(2k - 2) = 2|E(L(G))| \implies |E(L(G))| = m(k - 1).$$ I then tried this for a complete graph (so $k = m - 1$), and then removing edges one at a time until it becomes $G$, but this also requires knowledge of the edges.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. One piece of information that I seem to be not using is the variable $n$, the order of $G$, but I am not sure where it would be appropriate to use.</p>

A biclique covering of a graph is a covering of a graph with complete bipartite graphs (so that every edge of the initial graph belongs to at least one of the bipartite graphs that cover the initial graph). For each such covering of a graph, let the weight of a covering be the number of vertices of each of the subgraphs (the bipartite graphs) all added together. (i.e. if the graphs $H_1, H_2, \dots, H_m$ are the bipartite graphs that cover $G,$ then the weight of this covering will be $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^m |V(H_i)|,$ where $|V(H_i)|$ denotes the number of vertices in $H_i.$) The covering with the minimum such weight is $\text{bc}(G)$ for the graph $G.$ </p>

"<p>I'm stuck on this problem, posting my progress so far below. I've looked at similar questions <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/237134/prove-by-induction-that-every-connected-undirected-graph-with-n-vertices-has-at"">here</a> and <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/457042/prove-that-a-connected-graph-with-n-vertices-has-at-least-n-1-edges"">here</a>, but neither seem to directly prove the predicate by induction, with a base case followed by the inductive step. </p>

<p><strong>Solution(?):</strong></p>

<p>Let P(n) be the predicate (All n, n >= 1, any tree with n vertices has (n-1) edges).</p>

<p><strong>Base case (n=1):</strong></p>

<p>P(1): (n=1, any tree with 1 vertice has 0 edges). A tree <em>G</em> is a connected graph with no cycles of length at least three. An edge <em>E</em> is a two-element subset of the set of all vertices <em>V</em> of <em>G</em>. In the base case, <em>V</em> contains one vertice. Thus there are zero two-element subsets of <em>V</em>, or zero edges, in <em>G</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Inductive Step:</strong></p>

<p><s>For every n>0, P(n) => P(n+1).</p>

<p>For P(n+1), where n>0 in <em>G</em>, n+1 vertices will form exactly n edges. All vertices are of degree 1, which means there is exactly one less edge than vertice (one edge per vertice, excluding the root vertice). Thus, any tree with n vertices will have exactly n-1 edges.</p>

<hr>

<p>Assume P(n) is true. Then, we want to prove that the graph <em>G</em>, for P(n+1), has n edges. </p>

<p><em>G</em> contains no cycles of length at least three. Thus, <em>G</em> must contain only one region, meaning that the edges in <em>G</em> do not form any regions. This means that <em>G</em> must contain at least one leaf (vertex with degree of 1). </p>

<p>Obtain a graph <em>G'</em> by removing one leaf from <em>G</em>. Because a leaf is a vertex of 1, by the definition of vertex degree, the leaf is connected to exactly one edge. Thus, removing the leaf will remove one vertex and one edge from <em>G</em>, to create <em>G'</em>. This means that for all n, n>=1, any tree with (n+1) vertices will have ((n+1)-1). or n, edges. </p>

<p>We have proven that the case base P(1) is true, and assuming that P(n) is true, we see that the statement remains true for n => n+1. Thus, the predicate (All n, n >= 1, any tree with n vertices has (n-1) edges) is true by induction.
</s></p>

<hr>

<p>Assume P(n) is true. Then, we want to prove that the graph <em>G</em>, for P(n+1), has n edges.</p>

<p><em>G</em> contains no cycles of length at least three. Thus, <em>G</em> must contain only one region, meaning that the edges in <em>G</em> do not form any regions. This means that <em>G</em> must contain at least one leaf (vertex with degree of 1).  </p>

<p>Remove a leaf <em>l</em> from <em>G</em> to obtain a tree <em>G′</em> with n vertices. Then, <em>G'</em> has n−1 edges, by the inductive hypothesis. The addition of <em>l</em> to <em>G′</em> produces a graph with n+1 vertices and n edges, since <em>l</em> has degree 1.</p>

<p>P(1) is true, and for every n>0, P(n) => P(n+1). Thus, the predicate must be true.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assume that both $X$ and $X'$ have $n$ vertices. We plan to code the
  graph labels as suitable subgraphs which we attach to the vertices of
  $X$ and of $X'$. In time polynomial in the length of the input we can rename 
  the labels and may assume, therefore, that $L = \{1 ..... k\}$ is
  the set of labels assigned by $\lambda$ and $\mu$. <strong>Note that $k\leq2n$</strong> .We describe
  how to construct $Z$ from $(X,\lambda)$. The construction of
  $Z'$ is done in the same way. Let $X = (V,E), V = \{v_1..... v_n\}$.
  Intuitively, we obtain $Z$ from $X$ by attaching to each vertex $v_i$ a
  complete graph with $n + r$ vertices, where $\lambda (v_i) = r$. <strong>Note that $r\leq2n$.</strong>
  The vertices of the attached complete graph will be, for $v_i$, $\{v_{(i,1)},..... v_{(i,n+r)} \}$
   The subgraph is atached to $v_i$ by an edge $(v_i, v_{i,1})$.</p>
  
  <p>It is easy to see that $(X,\lambda)$ is
  isomorphic to $(X,\mu)$ iff $Z$ is isomorphic to $Z'$. <strong>Since there are at most</strong>
  <strong>$2n$ distinct labels</strong>, the graphs $Z$ and $Z'$ have no more than
  $2n^2+n$ vortices each and can thus be constructed in
  polynomial time.</p>

  <p>Let $X = (V,E)$ be a graph, $\lambda$ is  a mapping from $V$ onto a set $L = \{ l_1,...l_k\}$.
   Then the pair  $(X,\lambda)$ is a labelled graph.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question 1: Why $k\leq 2n$ which implies $r\leq2n$?   It seems that it should be $k\leq n$ since <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_labeling"" rel=""nofollow"">the passage of wikipedia here</a> tells</p>

"<p>I've been reading up on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph_%28algebra%29"" rel=""nofollow"">cycle graphs</a>, and the different and unique structures that groups produce really interest me. My question is, what is the requirements for a graph to be the cycle graph of a group?</p>

<p>For example, the graph on the left is not the cycle graph of a group, and the graph on the right is the cycle graph of $S_3$:</p>

<pre><code>    o       o  o  o
    |        \ | /
    e          e
   / \        / \ 
  o - o      o - o
</code></pre>

<p>By hand I know how I could tediously prove that the graph on the right isn't a cycle graph by showing that is doesn't have closure. The proof would go somehting along the lines of:</p>

<p>From the graph, we know that the group has four elements. We'll call them $e$ (identity), $b$ (element at the top), $a$ and $a^2$ (elements in the cycle at the bottom).</p>

<p>We now prove that $ab$ cannot be in the group by trying all the possibilities and come to contradictions in each case:
$$ab=e \implies b=a^2$$
$$ab=a \implies b=e$$
$$ab=a^2 \implies b=a$$
$$ab=b \implies a=e$$</p>

<p>and since each element is unique, none of these statements can be true.</p>

<p>This method works for this graph, however I run into trouble with more complicated graphs, and I am just wondering if there is an easier way of doing this or if there is a certain criteria for a graph to be a cycle graph of a group.</p>

So far, I tried to create an incremental process that will yield an appropriate neighbour for selected vertex $v$. So, one can remove $v$ and any $v$'s neighbour $u$ from $G$. The resulting graph can be connected or not. If it is connected, then we have found our neighbour and can stop the process. Otherwise, Graph $G$ is spliced into several components. It is clear that in each component should be at least one neighbour of $v$ as $G$ is 2-connected. I think that on this step I should choose one of these neighbours and remove it instead of initial $u$. But I cannot find the proof that it will not lead to another cut of the graph.</p>

<p>I made a quick search, but I'm not used to the mathematical vocabulary of this field but I'm pretty sure it exists. Then I studied this... ""set of rules"" a little bit.</p>

<p>Before the question, here are some interesting and maybe useful circuits.</p>

<p>This narcissistic bulb will never get off, because it's connected to itself by two bounds.
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WHfom.png"" alt=""Narcissistic turned on bulb (wow)""></p>

<p>This is an AND gate because, the bulb C will be lit (after 1 cycle) if and if only the bulb A AND the bulb B are lit.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/9MXZ8.png"" alt=""AND gate""></p>

<p>This is an OR gate because, the bulb C will be lit (after 1 cycle) if and if only the bulb A OR the bulb B is lit.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/A16wE.png"" alt=""OR gate""></p>

<p>I wanted to determine if I could build a computer with this set of rules. This is why I tried to determine the classical logic Boolean gates. But the NOT gate is essential to Boolean arithmetic, and I can't think of a way to create it or to prove it's impossible.</p>

<p>A NOT gate is supposed to be a circuit where if a bulb A is lit, then after a predetermined clock ticks, the bulb B will be off, and if A is off, B will be lit. A kind of inverter.</p>

"<p>Suppose that we have a decision tree of height $r + 1$ that describes how to increment an $n$-bit integer in the range $[0, 2^n -1]$. That is, the internal nodes are labelled with a bit position that you read, then depending on its value, you either go left or right and proceed to read the next bit indicated. The leaf nodes are labelled with a set of bits that are flipped to perform the increment operation. Note that the sequence of integers may not be the traditional Standard Binary Code, but could be any cyclic sequence of the $2^n$ integers. A Gray Code is another example of a sequence that may be produced (which corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle in the hypercube graph).</p>

<p>Now, consider the root to ""right before"" leaf paths as sets of size $r$ from a universe of size $n$. I am trying to argue the following claim: Suppose that the root node of our decision tree is labelled by index $i$. If we take the paths on the left side of the tree (when $i$ is read as  $0$) such that bit $i$ is not flipped, together with the paths on the right side of the tree (when $i$ is read as $1$) such that bit $i$ is flipped, then I am interested in bounding the size of the common intersection of those sets. In particular, we know that every set will contain index $i$ since it sits at our root node, but I would like to show that these sets must also have another bit in common.</p>

<p>I know that I do not want to use the sunflower lemma, as these sets may not have the same pairwise intersection, but I believe that I may be interested in something similar that characterizes the global intersection of all of these sets).

<p>Okay, that's a cool problem, but the part about ""visiting each city exactly once"" makes little sense to me. If I were a traveling salesman, I would just want to minimize the length (time, cost, whatever) of my route, and if visiting the same city $17$ times achieves this (say, because that city has an especially ""central"" position in the graph) then so be it.

"<p>I have noticed a recurring theme in Graph Theory / Theoretical Computer Science (abbreviated GT and TCS throughout this post) in that notions typically belonging to differential calculus / geometry / topology are ""discretized"" (by which I mean ""reformulated for a discrete-mathematical setting"") to be used for the service of GT/TCS. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discrete Morse Theory, which has been useful in the analysis of Boolean functions,</li>
<li>The Laplacian matrix, which carries a lot of worthwhile algebro-graphtheoretical properties,</li>
<li>The Cheeger constant for graphs, which is useful in the theory of expander graphs, as well as in the theory of distributed computing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course these are based on, respectively, the usual Morse Theory, the Laplace operator, and the Cheeger constant from Riemannian geometry.</p>

<p>My (soft) question is simple: Are there any other cases in GT, TCS or discrete math in general where this type of discretization has occurred? And why are those notions useful discretized? </p>

<p>For example, the Cheeger constant measures the ""bottle-neckedness"" of a graph, which when interpreted as describing a network used for distributed computing gives us limits on how fast we can compute things in a distributed network. The Laplacian is used heavily in algebraic GT / combinatorics and carries analogous structure to the ordinary Laplace operator, and Discrete Morse theory proves powerful theorems based on inequalities and critical points…(ok, I haven't delved too deep into any form of Morse theory yet…).</p>

<p>(Sure, this is a list-based question, but I figure there can't be that many examples to list?) </p>

"<p>Let $G$ be a <strong>connected</strong> graph. Prove that two longest paths in $G$ have atleast one node in common. Note that two longest paths do not neccessarily have the same length.</p>

<p>I began by defining two paths namely $P_1 = &lt;v_1,...,v_k&gt;$ and $P_2 =&lt;u_1,...,u_m&gt;$ where $m\neq k$ because of the note given. Now I state the definition of a conneted graph. </p>

<p>(For clarity, a vertex $V_1$ has an ""incoming edge"" if there is an edge $E$ which connects $V_1$ to some other vertex on the graph, $V_2$, for which $E$ is directed from $V_2$ to $V_1$)</p>

The reason I am posting this is because the result seems straightforward/obvious, and yet it would apparently solve an <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/16857/existence-of-a-zero-sum-subset"">open problem on MO regarding zero sum subsets</a>, so I am concerned that I may have a mistake.  (To be frank, I am not comfortable posting on MO)</p>

<p>The basic idea is to show that starting with a set of $N$ vertices, and no edges.  That it is impossible to construct a directed graph with no closed cycles by adding one (directed) edge at a time.</p>

<p>Let a set of $N$ vertices be given, and let us attempt to construct a directed graph with no closed cycle by adding one directed edge at a time.  Choose some arbitrary vertex $V_1 \in G$, then by the defining condition of $G$, $V_1$ must have an incoming edge, say from $V_2$.  It's clear that $V_2$ has an incoming edge, if this edge originates from $V_1$, then the graph would have a closed cycle, so we choose some other vertex which connects to $V_2$: and in this way we are forced to create a chain of $N-1$ vertices, $V_1$, has an edge coming from $V_2$, which has an edge coming from $V_3, \ldots, V_{N-2}$, which has an edge coming from $V_{N-1}$.  It's clear that if any of the vertices in this chain has an incoming edge originating from another vertex on the chain, that $G$ will contain a closed cycle.  So once we construct a chain of $N-1$ distinct vertices, there is one vertex left, and since this vertex must have an incoming edge originating from another vertex which is already on the chain, $G$ must contain a closed cycle.</p>

<p>Now let me explain why I think this fairly trivial result solves the <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/16857/existence-of-a-zero-sum-subset"">open zero sum subset problem</a> on MO.</p>

<p>This question asks: given a finite set of real numbers $S$ with the property that every number in the set can be written as the sum of two numbers in the set (not necessarily different), if there exists a subset $S$ which sums to zero.</p>

<p>Well, clearly a set $S$ which satisfies the condition of the problem stated above corresponds to a directed graph for which each vertex has at least one incoming edge (each real number in the set $S$ is associated with a vertex, and if given three numbers $a,b,c \in S$, with $a = b + c$, then the vertex associated with $a$ will have incoming edges from the vertices associated with $b$ and $c$).   Therefore the graph corresponding to an arbitrary S which satisfies the condition contains a closed cycle.  By adding the numbers in the closed cycle, we obtain a sum of the form:</p>

<p>$a + b + c + \ldots = a$, hence it follows that $b + c + \ldots = 0$, i.&thinsp;e. a set $S$ which satisfies the condition must contain a zero sum subset.  Have I made a mistake somewhere, or does this solve the problem? </p>

"<p>Let $G$ be a connected graph and $v$ be a vertex in $G$. Suppose a DFS traversal from $u$ is performed resulting in a tree $T$, and a BFS from $u$ also results in the same tree $T$. I would like to show that $T = G$.</p>

<p>My current thought is to go by contradiction and suppose that $T$ is both the DFS and BFS tree of $G$ with $u$ being the root, but $T \neq G$. As $T \subset G$, there must exist an edge $e \in G$ such that $e \notin T$ (since $G$ is connected it cannot be the case that there is a vertex in $G$ that is not in $T$).

<p>For 1 to k get the maximum edge of this Minimum spanning tree and delete it.</p>

<p>Proof that this work: </p>

<p>By induction:</p>

<p>Base Step($k=1$) :</p>

<p>Let $G$ be our graph of $n$ vertex and connected, getting a minimum spanning tree of $G$, we know we have a subgraph such all the vertex are connected there are no circuits and the sum of the weights of the edges is minimum.</p>

<p>If the sum of the weights of the edges is minimum, then this means the maximum weight of an edge is minimum. Then this step holds.</p>

<p>Inductive step(if $i-1 \rightarrow i$):</p>

<p>Let $G'$ be the minimum spanning tree. By Inductive hypothesis I know i can get the firsts $i-1$ edges and I get the disjoint graph the maximum weight of an edge is minimum for $i-1$ connected components. Then deleting the maximum weight edge, I get the disjoint graph the maximum weight of an edge is minimum for $i$ connected components.</p>

<p>I joined three spindles so that they were orthogonal.. then, beginning at the base of a particular spindle (A), wound it around another spindle, creating an arc connecting the two. After making some interesting figures I started to wonder about the combinatorial question of how many possible patterns could be created in this manner.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/aO7Vl.jpg"" alt=""Basic graphic example of question""></p>

<p>Assuming that each half spindle can hold some number ( arbitrary, but the same for all spindles) of winds (visits, essentially), and not excluding redundant patterns due to symmetry (once the basic question is answered, I will consider excluding these degenerate patterns).</p>

<p>A spindle <strong>can</strong> have arcs going back to itself (loops).</p>

<p>I've tried figuring it out using markov graphs, basic linear algebra and combinatoric techniques, but am very curious as to how other people would go about it.</p>

<p>-There will be times when the yarn 'paints itself into a corner', e.g. when 4/6 spindles have filled their holding capacity, and the thread must travel within the remaining nodes, ultimately cornering itself to eventually loop back its own node until completion (possibly even excluding some nodes entirely, leaving them untouched and unreachable). How could this be figured in to the problem?</p>

<p>I'm very excited to see how more mathematically mature problem solvers attack this :) </p>

I was wondering, if there existed a non-constructive way of calculating the size of a minimal vertex cover.

However, what if you know that the size of a minimal vertex cover is m, does this help you find such a covering?</p>

<p>My back of the envelope calculation tells me that, on a graph with n vertices, if you know that the size of a minimal vertex cover is m, you just need to check all subsets of V (the set of verticies) of size m, that is ${n \choose m} $. As a function of n, this has growth $O(n^n)$ i.e. not polynomial. So naively you don't get a polynomial reduction, and so the problem doesn't appear to be NP-hard.</p>

<h1><strong>The Challenge</strong></h1>

<p>My task is like this: I have to create an automatic program that will assign each student in a class (of variable size, but my own class now has 11 students) a reviewer for his assignment, according to a set of rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>The students sit in a row</li>
<li>One cannot review himself</li>
<li>Two students cannot review each other (reciprocally)</li>
<li>One cannot review his neighbor (from both sides)</li>
<li>One cannot review the student he reviewed the last time</li>
</ul>

<p>And the real trouble maker: </p>

<ul>
<li>One cannot review the student he reviewed two times before</li>
</ul>

<p>The programming implementation of this problem is not important – though so far the logic and algorithms that I've tried to implement have all failed (i.e. reaching a dead-end, or in the case of my programs, an infinite loop).</p>

<h1><strong>My previous approaches</strong></h1>

<p>At first I tried to simply throw a random number between 1 and the class size (11), check if it follows the rules (updating the availability of each student as we go, of course), and if so assigning that student as a reviewer. I found out very quickly that it often gets stuck on the last student, because the random assignments done prior leave the last student with no available reviewers according to the rules. </p>

<p>So this reminded me of the problem of coloring the map of the US states with 4 colors, and I tried another approach where before each assignment the program checks if that assignment will leave another student without any available reviewers – and only if it doesn't it assigns the reviewer, otherwise it looks for another random reviewer. </p>

<p>And this worked for 2 to 3 times, until it ALSO GOT STUCK (!!) And the reason is that it came into a situation where, say, after assigning 8 students, student 9 had two possibilities, and choosing 1 of them would leave student 10 with no available students while choosing the other would leave student 11 without one…</p>

<p>I didn't want to go up two levels and solve this problem, because it seemed I'm just pushing the problem one level higher each time. So I went for another approach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before each assignment check for the students with the least number of possible reviewers, and assign to him/her first. (Though I didn't implement it, you could probably still make it random after adding the rule that if there is more than one student who has the lowest number, choose one of them randomly.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This worked for about 10 times, until… you guessed it, it also got stuck. And for the last student there was no reviewer left which abided by the restrictions.</p>

<h1><strong>What I'm Looking For</strong></h1>

<ol>
<li>Well, an algorithm which will solve my problem; </li>
</ol>

<p>or</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>A proof that shows it cannot be done, i.e. that you cannot guarantee you would not get stuck at some point (at least not with 11 students and checking 2 times back);</li>
</ol>

<p>or at the very least</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Some help of finding relevant material that can advance me in my quest for the holy grail. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When checking only 1 time back, I didn't encounter any problem, though I'm not sure if this means that you can't encounter any dead-ends, or that it's just rarer to encounter them. </p>

<h2><strong>Big Note</strong></h2>

<p>I think there's an easy way, where you just assign each student the first available option, and rotate everyone exactly the same. </p>

<p>i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . ..
1   m 0 l s 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
2   0 m 0 l s 1 1 1 1 1 1
3   1 0 m 0 l s 1 1 1 1 1
4   1 1 0 m 0 l s 1 1 1 1
5   1 1 1 0 m 0 l s 1 1 1
6   1 1 1 1 0 m 0 l s 1 1
7   1 1 1 1 1 0 m 0 l s 1
8   1 1 1 1 1 1 0 m 0 l s
9   s 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 m 0 l
10  l s 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 m 0
11  1 l s 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 m
</code></pre>

<p>(m - self, l - last review , s - second last, 1 - available option, 0 - not available)</p>

<p>so, for the first student you choose number 5, for the 2nd you choose 6, etc. And the next time you rotate everyone one position.</p>

<p>It guess this will work, but I'm looking for a solution that doesn't require such a tidy arrangement of the students. Also – this is not random at all – it will be a series of (in this case) 8 other reviewers that each student will traverse, and it will keep repeating itself. I would prefer a more random assignment.</p>

<p>Though if you can show this is the only/best way, that would be good enough for me. </p>

David</p>

"<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>I was studying Theorem 2.3.3 from Introduction to Graph Theory by W. B. West. The main idea of his proof is as follows:
<br>
<b>T</b>, resulting tree.
<br>
<b>T<sup> *</sup></b>, spanning tree of minimum weight.
<br>
Let, T $\neq$ T<sup> *</sup>, then there are edges in T<sup> *</sup> that are not in T.
We first consider only 1 edge. Let's name it e. Hence, T<sup> *</sup> has all the edges that are in T, except e. Now, if we add e to T<sup> *</sup>, we should get a cycle, say 'C'. This implies, C has an edge that is not in T. Let's name it e'. Now we get spanning tree T<sup> *</sup>+ e - e'.
Now, let us think what happened when Kruskal ran and produced T. It examined all edges in G. Including e and e'. But, it included only e. So, w(e)$\leq$w(e').</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus T<sup> *</sup>+ e - e' is a spanning tree with weight at most T<sup> *</sup> that agrees with T for a <em>longer initial list</em> of edges than T<sup> *</sup> does.</p>

<p>Or, if G = Hypercube ""H_4"" with 4 vertices, and G' = Complete biparite graph ""K_1, 3"".</p>

"<p>Let $G=(V,E)$ be a countably infinite directed acyclic graph and $L$ be a finite set of vertex labels. The number $\left|V\right|$ of vertices is countable infinity and some vertices may have an infinite number of ingoing edges. I am interested in the existence of labelings $f: V \rightarrow L$ where the label $f(v)$ is determined by the labels of the predecessors of $v$.</p>

<p>More formally, let there be a function $g_v:L^{\mathrm{indeg}(v)} \rightarrow L$ for each vertex $v \in V$. Does there exist a labeling $f : V \rightarrow L$ such that for every vertex $v \in V$ with predecessors $p_0, p_1,\ldots$ the following holds?
$$f(v) = g_v(f(p_0), f(p_1), \ldots)$$</p>

<p>Intuitively, it appears very clear to me that the acyclicity of $G$ guarantees the existence of such labelings $f$. But how do I prove that?</p>

<p>For a trivial example, consider the infinite path $G = (\mathbb{Z}, \{(v,v+1):v\in\mathbb{Z}\})$, $L = \{0, 1\}$ and $g_v:L\rightarrow L:x\mapsto 1 - x$. In this case there are exactly two labelings, one that assigns 0 and 1 to every even and odd vertex, respectively, and the other with 0 and 1 switched.</p>

<p>If we drop the requirement of acyclicity, a counterexample would be an odd directed cycle graph and $L$ and $g$ as in the example above. Here no labeling exists.</p>

<p>In the case of finite DAGs, I would prove the existence inductively over an topological ordering of $G$, starting by an arbitrary label-assignment for vertices without ingoing edges and then iteratively constructing the labeling for vertices whose predecessors have already been labeled. However, I fail to generalize this technique to infinite graphs in the absence of an induction basis.</p>

"<p>I have to answer the question : ""Is it true that in all finite graphs (connected graphs) wchich $\delta \ge 2$ ($\delta$ is the smallest degree of vertices in a graph) exists the cycle of length equal to $\delta+1$ or longer"". I believe this statement is true. I drew some graphs and it seems to be true. I do not know how to prove this in mathematical way. I will glad for help and advice.</p>

"<p>Let $f:G \to G$ be a bijective function on a finite simple connected graph which preserves adjacency (if $x$ is adjacent to $x'$ then $f(x)$ is adjacent to $f(x')$). Is $f$ automatically a graph automorphism?</p>

"<p>I was reading up on probabilistic graphical theory and it's not very clear how the flow of probabilistic influence differs between directed and undirected graph. My initial assumption was that flow is one way i.e. from parent to child only in case of directed graphs but that does not seem to be the case. </p>

<p>I will highly appreciate if anyone can elaborate upon this? </p>

"<p>I am currently working on determining the maximum number of times the minimum spherical distance can occur among $n$ points in $\mathbb{S}^2$, and I have the following question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In $\mathbb{E}^2$, I cite from Pach and Agarwal's Combinatorial Geometry: ""The internal angle of a simple closed polygon $C$ which bounds a graph $G$ at a vertex of degree $d$ is at least $(d-1)\frac{\pi}{3}$."" How does this statement generalize to $\mathbb{S}^2$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In particular, I am not sure how the statement is arrived at in $\mathbb{E}^2$, and for this reason I am unable to generalize it to $\mathbb{S}^2$.</p>

<p>EDIT: To make the question clear, I am asking for a proof or explanation of the statement quoted in $\mathbb{E}^2$, and maybe an idea for how to generalize it to $\mathbb{S}^2$. An explanation of the statement in $\mathbb{E}^2$ is sufficient for an accepted answer though. When I try constructing a graph the $(d-1)\frac{\pi}{3}$ makes sense and gives a lower bound for the angle at a vertex of degree $d$ but I don't know where it is coming from.</p>
