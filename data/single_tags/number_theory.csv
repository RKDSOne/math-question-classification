<p>Following is my reason for the kernel is discrete.</p>

<p>Suppose
$$
\varphi:\mathbb{C}/\Lambda\rightarrow\mathbb{C}/\Lambda'

<p>is an isogeny. Then there exists $m\in \mathbb{C}$ such that $m\Lambda=\Lambda'$. So the kernel of $\varphi$ is $\left(\frac{1}{m}\Lambda'\right)/\Lambda$. Intuitively, it is discrete, I think. But I don't know how to reason it. </p>

<p>There is a hint in the book I'm reading saying that if the kernel is not discrete, complex analysis shows that the map is zero.</p>

"<p>Ok,this problem might appear a bit trivial but I have some doubts..If it's not a burden take a look and comment!</p>

<p>Let $F$ be a finite field of characteristic equal to $p$ and $ƒ(x)=x^p-α$ $∊F[x]$.Show that $ƒ(x)$ either has one root of multiplicity equal to $p$ or that $ƒ(x)$ is irreducible over $F$.</p>

<p>My answer:</p>

<p>Let $x₁$ and $x₂$ be two different roots of $ƒ(x)$.
Then it follows: $x₁^p-α=x₂^p-α=0$ ⇒$x₁^p-x₂^p=0$ 
But since the characteristic of the field is $p$,it derives from Euler's theorem that in general: $(b-c)^p=b^p-c^p$ for any $b,c∊F$</p>

<p>Thus:$(x₁-x₂)^p=0⇒x₁=x₂$.
So $ƒ(x)$ can have no distinct roots.
If $α$ is a root,then indeed $(x-α)^p=0$ and $α$ is a root of multiplicity equal to $p$.
Since no other factorization of $ƒ(x)$ exists-that is one that does not include the $(x-α)$ factor,it follows that if $α$ is not a root,then $ƒ(x)$ is irreducible.</p>

<p>I been reading quit a lot about this topic and I found many solutions</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination"" rel=""nofollow"">Gaussian elimination</a>: This perhaps the most common approach for this problem. It's running time is $O(N^3)$ above GF (2)</li>

You can read more about it <a href=""https://martinralbrecht.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/ple.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>(section 3.2). </li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Wiedemann_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">Block Wiedemann algorithm</a> is used to parallelize the matrix of several machines in order to speed up the process. Here is a good example of such <a href=""https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/TOPICS/factoring/fastgauss.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">implementation over GAPP</a>, they use a little bit different algorithm for that.</li>
</ul>

<p>But non of the above was good enough for me, so I created my own <a href=""https://github.com/gazman-sdk/quadratic-sieve/blob/master/src/com/gazman/factor/matrix/HashMatrix.java"" rel=""nofollow"">algorithm</a>.</p>

<p>It's based on <strong>Gaussian elimination</strong>, but instead of searching for pivot in each column I represent the columns with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table"" rel=""nofollow"">hash table</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list"" rel=""nofollow"">linked list</a>(This is how HashMap in java is implemented) where each node of the list is stored in <strong>hash table</strong> and contain the pivot index of the original matrix. So I can iterate over all the pivots of column. </p>

<p>When I start to perform <strong>Gaussian elimination</strong> it only takes $O(1)$ to find the first pivot of a column, once I find such pivot I store it in another <strong>hash  table</strong>, so I want pick it for the next column I will operate. Next I iterate over the reset of the pivot of the first column and xor the rows to eliminate all the reset of the pivot of the first column. I do the same trick with the rows, so I got duplicate representation of the matrix, by hash-table rows and columns. This allows me to speed up the row xoring process as I only iterate over the row pivot. The xor operation itself of each node is $O(1)$ but it evolves 2 hash operations and it's by it self quite expensive. And so this is the part where this algorithm fails. Even so that I estimate it's performance as sub-quadratic on average. </p>

<p>I ended up <a href=""https://github.com/gazman-sdk/quadratic-sieve/blob/master/src/com/gazman/factor/matrix/BitMatrix.java"" rel=""nofollow"">implementing</a> classic <strong>Gaussian elimination</strong> using bit operators and it allows me to process square matrices with up to $10,000$ lines in minutes time. But it's not fast enough for me, my goal is factoring 100 digits number, this require around 1M square matrix size, and this impossible with my current approach. </p>

"<p>Bertrand's postulate states that for any integer $n&gt;3$, there's always a prime $p$ between $n$ and $2n-2$.
That result sets a reasonable 'lower bound' on how often we can expect primes to show up, and there are even better estimates (such as the Prime Number Theorem, although that one is an asymptote, and doesn't prove any result for a specific $n$).</p>

<p>However, the proofs of the results above aren't obvious; I'm looking for elementary claims, ones that follow straight from the definition of a prime number (and perhaps some algebraic manipulation).</p>

<p>For example, the following can be deduced using Euclid's method for the infinitude of primes:</p>

<p><strong>Claim:</strong> Let $M_n$ Denote the product of all primes smaller than or equal to $n$. Then, if $n \geq 2$, there's at least one prime $p$ such that $n&lt;p\leq M_n+1$.</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> If $M_n+1$ is prime, we're done.</p>

<p>Otherwise, $M_n+1$ is divisible by a smaller prime $p$. Then $p$ can't divide $M_n$. but $M_n$ is divisible by all numbers smaller than or equal to $n$, so we get $n&lt;p&lt;M_n+1$, just as we wanted. $\square$</p>

<p>In particular, this shows that there's always a prime number between $n$ and $n!$.</p>

<p>Now, how can we lower this bound? Is there any elementary proof for how there's always a prime between $n$ and $n^2$? What about, say,  $n$ and $1000^n$?</p>

<p>The proof is:</p>

<p>Suppose $\exists\gamma\in Q_p$ such that $|\alpha -\gamma^2|_p&lt;1$, (i.e. $\beta^2\equiv\alpha(modp)$ is soluble).
Now we construct a sequence $(\beta_n)$ by letting $\beta_1=\gamma$ and defining $\beta_n$ to satisfy:</p>

<p>$|\beta_n^2-\alpha|_p&lt;\frac{1}{p^n}$ and $|\beta_{n+1}-\beta_n|&lt;\frac{1}{p^n}$</p>

<p>If we take $\beta_n$ as given, then we take $\beta_{n+1}=\beta_n+\delta_n$, so that $\beta_{n+1}^2=\beta_n^2+2\beta_n\delta_n+\delta_n^2$, and it is sufficient to take $\delta_n=\frac{\alpha-\beta_n^2}{2\beta_n}$.</p>

<p>Conversely, the necessity is obvious if we choose $\gamma=\beta^2$. $\square$</p>

<p>I feel that I'm missing something which is stopping me from understand this. $|\beta_{n+1}-\beta_n|_p&lt;\frac{1}{p^n}\implies p^n$ divides $(\beta_{n+1} - \beta_n)$, and if $\beta_{n+1}=\beta_n+\delta_n$ then this must mean $\delta_n$ is divisible by $p^n$.</p>

<p>If we take $\delta_n$ as $\delta_n=\frac{\alpha-\beta_n^2}{2\beta_n}$, then this gives us $\beta_{n+1}^2=\alpha+\delta_n^2 \implies \beta_{n+1}^2-\alpha=\delta_n^2$. Then we have shown that $\beta_{n+1}-\alpha$ is divisible by $p^{n+1}$, i.e. that $|\beta_{n+1}^2-\alpha|_p&lt;\frac{1}{p^{n+1}}$.</p>

<p>Let 4 variables $a,b,c,d$ be rationals in $[0,1]$ which, when multiplied by $255$, become integers. (That is, $a,b,c,d\in \{\frac{x}{255}\mid 0\leq x\leq 255,\ x\in\mathbb{Z}\}$.  Examples of valid values are $1/255$, $2/255$, $3/255$, etc.</p>

<p>One way to determine this is to test all ($255^4=4228250625$) possible combinations, however I'm looking for a more compelling proof.</p>

<p>Both the numerator and denominator will each evaluate to a non-negative integer value. That being said, a part of the set of possible evaluated fractions will look like this:

<p>The denominator must evaluate to an even number.</p>

<p>Here are some of the rules of parity (even or odd) arithmetic:</p>

<p>Addition/subtraction:</p>

<pre><code>      Even Odd
     __________
Even |Even Odd
Odd  |Odd  Even
</code></pre>

<p>Multiplication:</p>

<pre><code>      Even Odd
     __________
Even |Even Even
Odd  |Even Odd
</code></pre>

<p>The denominator has only two variables $a$ and $b$ that I need to worry about. Let's consider the possible cases of parity and see which combinations result in an even number.</p>

<p>$$255^2a + 255(255-a)b$$
$$(\mathrm{Odd})a + (\mathrm{Odd})((\mathrm{Odd})-a)b$$</p>

<pre><code>$a$: Even; $b$: Even
(Odd)(Even) + (Odd)((Odd)-(Even))(Even)
(Even) + (Odd)(Odd)(Even)
(Even) + (Odd)(Even)
(Even) + (Even)
(Even)

a: Odd; b: Even
(Odd)(Odd) + (Odd)((Odd)-(Odd))(Even)
(Odd) + (Odd)(Even)(Even)
(Odd) + (Even)(Even)
(Odd) + (Even)
(Odd)

a: Even; b: Odd
(Odd)(Even) + (Odd)((Odd)-(Even))(Odd)
(Even) + (Odd)(Odd)(Odd)
(Even) + (Odd)(Odd)
(Even) + (Odd)
(Odd)

a: Odd; b: Odd
(Odd)(Odd) + (Odd)((Odd)-(Odd))(Odd)
(Odd) + (Odd)(Even)(Odd)
(Odd) + (Even)(Odd)
(Odd) + (Even)

</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, the denominator is only even when both $a$ and $b$ are even. Let's see the parity of the numerator with $a$ and $b$ both being even.</p>

<p>$$255ac + (255-a)bd$$</p>

<pre><code>(Odd)(Even)c + ((Odd)-(Even))(Even)d
(Even)c + (Odd)(Even)d
(Even)c + (Even)d

"<p>I'm writing a primality testing program and want to test numbers like $3^{3^{3^{100}}} + 4
\mod 7$.</p>

<p>I use Euler's theorem to do this, so that the exponents get smaller. Instead of calculating $a^{b^c} \mod n$, I calculate $a^{b^{c \mod n_2}\mod n_1} \mod n$, where $n_1 = \phi(n)$ and $n_2 = \phi(\phi(n))$. This works sometimes, however, sometimes the exponent and the modulo is not relativly prime and Euler's theorem can not be used. Like in the above example with $3^{3^{3^{100}}} + 4
\mod 7$, it works in the first step, but not in the second, because $\gcd(3,6)\neq 1$.</p>

<p>One mathematician told me many years ago that it doesnt matter, because if you calculate $a^{(b \mod n_1)+n_1} \mod n$, it will still equal $a^b \mod n$. Even in the cases where $\gcd(a, n)\neq 1 $. I have tested this and it seems to work.</p>

<p>My questions are:
Under what circumstances does this work? Are there any exceptions, like $a = 0$ or $1$ or anything?</p>

<p>What theorems does this trick rely upon? What is the formal proof that it works? I don't want to use math that I dont understand in my program and I dont really understand why this works.</p>

<p>The main idea is that the number that should be tested is large, and the modulo is small. However, if anybody could give any hints of how to do it when the modulo is large, like ($2^{300}+1$) it would also be appreciated. It might be good for further, more advanced testing. It is enough to know that $a^b \mod n = c $ with a certain probability, if $n$ is large. I feel that this should be possible to do in some way, but I don't know how.</p>

It can also be proved by simply playing with trigonometric polynomials (i.e., polynomials in $e^{2\pi i k x}$ for $k$ an integer) and using the fact they are dense in the space of all continuous functions with period 1.  In particular, one shows that if $f(x)$ is a continuous function with period 1, then for any $t$,  $\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \lim \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f(t+i \xi)$.

<p>An element of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$ would look like $a+b\sqrt{m}$ where $a,b$ are rational integers $0, \pm1, \pm2,...$  The norm is defined as $N(\alpha)=\alpha\bar{\alpha}$, where $\bar{\alpha}$ is defined as the conjugate of $\alpha$ ($\alpha=a+b\sqrt{m}, \bar{\alpha}=a-b\sqrt{m}$).</p>

$$-1\le a^2+b^2m\le 1$$
However, with $m\ge 2$ this is impossible unless either $a=b=0$ or $a=1, b=0$.  But these cannot be since we have restricted these conditions in the initial problem.  Therefore
$|N(\alpha)|&gt;1$. </p>

<p>I'm solving the red book of math problems, problem 16 which is to solve the following recurrence relation:</p>

<p>$\sum_{k=1}^n {n \choose k} a(k) = \frac{n}{n+1}$</p>

<p>PS: ${n \choose k}  = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ (it is not the Legendre symbol).</p>

<p>for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$</p>

<p>I'm wondering if it's possible to use Moebius Inversion formula with</p>

<p>$G(x) = \frac{x}{x+1}$ (one can define it to be zero if $0&lt;x&lt;1$)</p>

<p>and some $F$ I know one can use differential equations theory to solve this one, but I want to try to solve it by this way</p>

<p>spoiler alert: $a(k) = \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k+1}$</p>

"<p>What's with the definition of Bezout's Identity? As I understand it, it states that if $d = \gcd(a, b)$, then there exist integers $x,\ y$ such that $ax+by=d$. </p>

<p>Why the requirement that $d=\gcd(a,b)$ though? It seems to work even when this isn't the case. For example, let $a = 17$ and $b = 4$. Then $d = 1$, however setting $d = 2$ still generates an infinite number of solutions:
$$
x = -4n-2,\quad\quad y=17n+9\\
n\in\Bbb{Z}
$$
and for $(a,\ b,\ d) = (19,\ 17,\ 5)$ we get $x=-17n-6$ and $y=19n+7$. However for $(a,\ b,\ d) = (44,\ 55,\ 12)$ we <em>do</em> have no solutions.</p>

<p>So what's the fuss? Why require $d=\gcd(a,b)$? Is it like, you can't <em>guarantee</em> the existence of solutions to $ax+by=d$ unless $d=\gcd(a,b)$, and I just stumbled across a case where it happens to work? In that case can we classify <em>all</em> the cases where there are solutions $x,\ y$, more specifically than just $d=\gcd(a,b)$?</p>

"<p>So we choose two large primes p and q and multiply them together to get n.
We also pick an encryption exponent e and so for any message m, we can compute m^e (mod n) which is our ciphertext c.</p>

<p>So anyways, I understand (or rather, I'm familiar with) Fermat's little theorem that x^(p-1) is congruent to 1 mod p, as well as Euler's theorem, which seems to just tie together FLT and the notion that for any prime p, since there are p-1 numbers less than p that are coprime to p, $\phi(p) = p-1$</p>

<p>My question: since c is just m^e, then if we can find d, by solving de = 1 (mod p-1 * q-1), and then compute m by taking c^d = m^ed = m (mod n). What I don't understand is where the equation de = 1 (mod $\phi(n)$) comes from. Like why are we modding by (p-1)(q-1) instead of n? </p>

<p><strong>Inspriation:</strong> I was dumbfounded by the fact that: $$\hat\prod_\limits{n=1}^\infty P_{n}=4\pi^2$$ 
After further investigation, I learned of many other properties of zeta-regulation, as well as their proofs (to a reasonable extent). I realized nothing had been done of this question: $$2*5*11\cdots=\hat\prod_\limits{n=1}^\infty P_{2n-1}=\kappa$$

Unfortunately, I couldn't really figure out how to apply that on to this here. I was driven, from Resource 1, that a <em>potential</em> to use bounds was created, but my inability to logically understand this problem made it impossible to determine if $4\pi^2$ or $\sqrt{2\pi}$ would be upper or lower.</p>

"<p>Suppose we have a fixed (generally composite) $k$, and we want to find the largest power of $k$ that divides $n!$ for $n$ large.</p>

<p>If $k$ is square-free, we need only consider the behavior of the largest prime $p$ dividing $k$: if $p^i | n!$, then certainly $q^i|n!$ for any prime $q&lt;p$, and so $k^i|n!$.</p>

<p><em>Most of the time</em>, when $k$ is composite, a similar argument is possible and we need only consider a single prime factor of $k$. Legendre's formula for the prime factorization of $n!$ tells us that the highest power of $p$ dividing $n!$ is
$$
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^j}\right\rfloor = \frac{n}{p-1} + O(\log n) \, .
$$
So, for a fixed prime power $p^a$, the largest power of $p^a$ that divides $n!$ is $\frac{n}{a(p-1)} + o(n)$.</p>

<p>It follows that, if $k=p_1^{a_1}\dots p_n^{a_n}$, then we need only consider those $p_i$ which minimize $a_i(p_i-1)$. Most of the time there will only be one such $p_i$, in which case our life is no harder than it was when $k$ was square-free.</p>

<p>For example, if $k=24$, then we are interested only in the divisibility of $n!$ by the prime powers $8$ and $3$. The above analysis tells us that the largest power of $8$ that divides $n!$ is roughly $\frac{n}{3(2-1)}=\frac{n}{3}$, while the largest power of $3$ that divides $n!$ is roughly $\frac{n}{3-1}=\frac{n}{2}$. So the largest power of $24$ that divides $n!$ is always the same as the largest power of $8$ that divides $n!$, for $n$ sufficiently large.</p>

<p>However, there are exceptions!</p>

<p>For example, if $k=12=2^2 \cdot 3$, then the largest power of both $4$ and $3$ that divides $n!$ will be roughly $\frac{n}{2}$. Numerical experimentation suggests that $n!$ <em>usually</em> has more than twice as many factors of $2$ as it has factors of $3$, but the number of exceptions is large (for $n&lt;10^7$, the factors of $2$ are the scarce ones about $17\%$ of the time, and that number seems to decrease only slowly as $n$ increases).</p>

<p>This made me curious as to what are the connected components of $\Bbb{Q}_p$ and whether there is a characterization for the components in terms of the $p$-adic metric (or any characterization at all). But I couldn't find anything on doing a Google search. </p>

<p>Hence, I thought it best to ask this question here in the hope that others might also find it interesting and something might come up. </p>

<p>So finally my question is - What are the connected components of $\Bbb{Q}_p$ and what interesting information do they tell us? Further, how do we compare or contrast this situation with that of $\Bbb{R}$? </p>

<p>Suppose I am performing an NTT in a finite field $GF(p)$. I assume it contains the needed primitive root of unity.</p>

<p>I am using it to compute the convolution of two vectors of length $n=2^m, m\in \mathbb{N}$. As usual, I double the length of the vectors to $2n=2^{m+1}$ to make the convolution in fact acyclic (right? may be wrong here) and thus guarantee the exact interpolation of the product during INTT. </p>

<p>These vectors are in fact long integers, with all coefficients less than $BASE\in\mathbb{N}$. I wanted to come up with an inequality for the prime number $p$ so that the convolution is recoverable (i.e. equal to the real product of polynomials). </p>

<p>Here are my considerations:</p>

<p>The worst case is when all coefficients of the vectors are equal to $BASE-1$. Then the convolution coefficients are</p>

<p>$$c_0 = a_0 b_0 = (BASE-1)^2$$
$$c_1 = a_0 b_1 + a_1 b_0 = 2\cdot (BASE-1)^2$$
$$...$$
$$c_{n-1} = a_0 b_{n-1} + ... + a_{n-1} b_0 = n\cdot (BASE-1)^2$$
$$c_n = \underbrace{a_0 b_n}_{=0} + a_1 b_{n-1} + ... + a_{n-1} b_1 + \underbrace{a_n b_0 }_{=0} = (n-1)\cdot (BASE-1)^2$$
...
$$c_{2n-1}=0$$.</p>

<p>Thus I have come up with an inequality for the prime $p$:</p>

<p>$$n \cdot (BASE-1)^2 &lt; p.$$</p>

<p>Does it guarantee that the convolution is computed correctly or have I missed something?</p>

"<p>Let $S$ be a set of size $n$.  There is an easy way to count the number of subsets with an even number of elements.  Algebraically, it comes from the fact that</p>

<p>$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} = (1 + 1)^n$</p>

<p>while</p>

<p>$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k {n \choose k} = (1 - 1)^n$.</p>

<p>It follows that </p>

<p>$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n/2} {n \choose 2k} = 2^{n-1}$.  </p>

<p>A direct combinatorial proof is as follows: fix an element $s \in S$.  If a given subset has $s$ in it, add it in; otherwise, take it out.  This defines a bijection between the number of subsets with an even number of elements and the number of subsets with an odd number of elements.</p>

<p>The analogous formulas for the subsets with a number of elements divisible by $3$ or $4$ are more complicated, and divide into cases depending on the residue of $n \bmod 6$ and $n \bmod 8$, respectively.  The algebraic derivations of these formulas are as follows (with $\omega$ a primitive third root of unity):  observe that</p>

<p>$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} \omega^k {n \choose k} = (1 + \omega)^n = (-\omega^2)^n$</p>

<p>while</p>

<p>$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} \omega^{2k} {n \choose k} = (1 + \omega^2)^n = (-\omega)^n$</p>

<p>and that $1 + \omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 0$ if $k$ is not divisible by $3$ and equals $3$ otherwise.  (This is a special case of the discrete Fourier transform.)  It follows that</p>

<p>$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n/3} {n \choose 3k} = \frac{2^n + (-\omega)^n + (-\omega)^{2n}}{3}.$</p>

<p>$-\omega$ and $-\omega^2$ are sixth roots of unity, so this formula splits into six cases (or maybe three).  Similar observations about fourth roots of unity show that</p>

"<p>Open problem in Geometry/Number Theory.  The real question here is:</p>

<p><em>Is there an infinite family of points on $y=x^2$, for $x \geq 0$, such that the distance between each pair is rational?</em></p>

<p>The question of ""if not infinite, then how many?"" follows if there exists no infinite family of points that satisfies the hypothesis.</p>

<p>We have that there exists a (in fact, infinitely many) three point families that satisfy the hypothesis by the following lemma and proof.</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 1:</strong>  <em>There are infinitely many rational distance sets of three points on $y=x^2$.</em></p>

<p>The following proof is by Nate Dean.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em>  Let $S$ be the set of points on the parabola $y = x^2$ and let $d_1$ and $d_2$ be two fixed rational values.  For any point, $P_0(r)=(r, r^2) \in S$, let $C_1(r)$ be the circle of radius $d_1$ centered at $P_0(r)$ and let $C_2(r)$ be the circle of radius $d_2$ centered at $P_0(r)$.  Each of these circles must intersect $S$ in at least one point. Let $P_1(r)$ be any point in $C_1(r) \cap S$ and likewise, let $P_2(r)$ be any point in $C_2(r) \cap S$.  Now let $dist(r)$ equal the distance between $P_1(r)$ and $P_2(r)$. The function $dist(r)$ is a continuous function of $r$ and hence there are infinitely many values of $r$ such that $P_0(r)$, $P_1(r)$,
and $P_2(r)$ are at rational distance. $ \blacksquare $</p>

<p>This basically shows that the collection of families of three points that have pairwise rational distance on the parabola is dense in $S$.</p>

<p>Garikai Campbell has shown that there are infinitely many nonconcyclic rational distance sets of four points on $y = x^2$ in the following paper: <a href=""http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2004-73-248/S0025-5718-03-01606-5/S0025-5718-03-01606-5.pdf"">http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2004-73-248/S0025-5718-03-01606-5/S0025-5718-03-01606-5.pdf</a></p>

<p>However, to my knowledge, no one has come forward with 5 point solutions, nor has it been proven that 5 point solutions even exist.</p>

<p>But I know that many people have not seen this problem!  Does anyone have any ideas on how to approach a proof of either the infinite case or even just a 5 point solution case?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  The above Lemma as well as the paper by Garikai Campbell do <strong>not</strong> include the half-parabola ($x \geq 0$) restriction.  However, I thought that the techniques that he employed could be analogous to techniques that we could use to make progress on the half-parabola version of the problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Show that the prime number 27644437 splits completely in $L = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{55})$.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>From what I understand. This deals with ramification. </p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_1^{r}e_if_i = n &amp;, &amp;\text{where }n = [L:K]
\end{eqnarray}</p>

<p>For our prime number, $p$, to split completely into $L$, then $e_i=f_i =1$ for all $i$. Now in order for it to be completely split, it can not be ramified. Being ramified will require at least one of the $e_i&gt;1$. However, we do not need to worry about this situation in this problem because $p\not| \text{disc}(L)$. </p>

<p>Minimal Polynomial of $L$ is $x^2-55$. Since it is not ramified, this will only leave two possibilities: inert or split. Since we are dealing with a second degree polynomial and we already ruled out the possibility of being ramified, then it must be completely split. Thus, inert or completely split. </p>

<p>This is where it gets complicated. If I want to show it is completely split I need to find at least one integer such that $x^2 -55 (\text{mod}p) = 0$. </p>

<p>I do not need to find the second integer because $p$ does not ramify $L$. Looking over so many numbers just to verify it meets this condition is ridiculous. There has to be another approach.</p>

<p>I asked my professor and he gave me a hint suggesting I use the Quadratic Reciprocity Law. However, I do not know how to apply it correctly in this case. I would assume looking at the Quadratic Residue symbol formed by the discriminate of $L$ and the prime number $p$.

<p>""So how fair are the prime number dice? Mathematicians call a dice ""fair"" if the difference between the theoretical behaviour of the dice and the actual behaviour after $N$ tosses is within the region of the square root of $N$. The heights of Riemann's harmonics are given by the east-west coordinate of the corresponding point at sea-level. If the east-west coordinate is $c$ then the height of the wave grows like $N^c$. This means the contribution from this harmonic to the error between Gauss's guess and the real number of primes will be $N^c$. So if the Riemann Hypothesis is correct and $c$ is always $1/2$, the error will always be $N^{1/2}$ (which is just another way of writing the square root of $N$). If true, the Riemann Hypothesis means that Nature's prime number dice are fair, never straying more than the square root of $N$ from Gauss's theoretical prime number dice.""</p>

<p>However, we know from Helge von Koch (1901)[2] that if the Rieman Hypothesis true, then:

"<p>A few months ago, someone told me there existed a scheme theoretic proof of the irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials. I've tried coming up with a proof, and when that didn't really yield anything $($just the scattered thoughts I have below$)$, I searched online for a reference to a proof, to no avail. Can anyone provide a proof or a reference to one? Does a proof even exist via schemes, or was this someone trolling me? Would this question be a better fit on MathOverflow?</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts so far on such a proof, if it were to exist.</p>

<p>The standard linear algebraic $($or in context of ""modern"" frameworks, the ""$p$-adic""$)$ formulation of the irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials is as follows.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The degree of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)/\mathbb{Q}$ is $[\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n):\mathbb{Q}] = \phi(n)$.</p>

<p>This is saying is that the vector space generated by the powers of $\zeta_n$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is of dimension $\phi(n)$. The most important case in the proof is where $n = p$, where one shows that the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$ has dimension $p-1$. This is done by showing $$\dim_\mathbb{Q}(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)) = \dim_\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]) = \dim_{\mathbb{F}_p}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]/p),$$and that $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_p}(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]/p) = p-1$.</p>

<p>Now, the purpose of scheme theory is to make geometry out of rings. In the case of this elusive proof, I imagine the scheme theoretic perspective claims that the extension of rings $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]/\mathbb{Z}$ is like a ramified cover of topological spaces. One imagines $\mathbb{Z}$ as space populated by its primes, and similarly for $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]$. The scheme theoretic restatement of the above theorem is that this is a connected cover of degree $\phi(n)$. In the standard proof of the linear algebraic formulation above one sees this by looking above the prime $p$, where one sees ""nilpotency"" of order $p-1$, which implies that the cover must have degree $p-1$.</p>

"<p>In my algebraic structures textbook I have come across a tricky question that I am trying to solve which goes as follows:</p>

<p>suppose that $d|(a^n-1) $ and $d|(a^m-1)$ where  $m,n$ are natural numbers and $a,d$ are integers, then show that $ d|(a^{gcd(m,n)}-1) $ . What I know is that clearly $a^m$ and $a^n$ are congruent to 1 modulo d, and that by Bezout's theorem the $gcd(m,n)$ is of the form $k=xm+yn$ so that $a^{gcd(m,n)}$ can be written as $a^{xm}a^{yn}$ but I am not sure how to tie all these ideas together. Any hints would be appreciated.</p>

<p>For $a,b,c \in \{-100,-99, \dots , 99, 100\}$, the set of integers $n \in \{0,1,\dots , 99,100 \}$ we get is<br>
$$\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 12, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 63, 64, 65, 96 \}$$The point is that it is exactly the same for $a,b,c \in \{-10000,-9999, \dots , 9999, 10000\}$, so that we could expect that there is no other natural number $n \le 100$ representable like that.

  <blockquote>
    <p>Let $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[m]{a},\sqrt[n]{b}) $, where $m,n,a,b$ are positive integers such that they are pairwise coprime. Assume that $[K:\mathbb{Q}]=mn$/ Prove that no prime numbers can totally ramify in $K/\mathbb{Q}$.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume we would need to find such prime numbers that are ramified in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[m]{a})/\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{b})/\mathbb{Q}$ respectively. I know if $p|\text{disc}(L)$, then it is ramified. The discriminate can be found using the following:</p>

<p>$$
\text{disc}(\alpha) = (-1)^{\frac{k(k-1)}{2}}\left[(-1)^{1-k}(k-1)^{k-1}c^k + k^kd^{k-1}\right]
$$</p>

<p>Where $f(x) = x^k + cx + d$. And since $a,b,n,m$ are pairwise coprime, then disc($K$)=disc$(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[m]{a}))^n$disc$(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{b}))^m$. </p>

<p>Now if there is a prime number that will totally ramify in $K/\mathbb{Q}$, then there is only one ramification index, $e_i$, such that $e = mn = [K:\mathbb{Q}]$. All I would need to do is show that there is more than one ramification index via transitivity. This is where I am stuck. How would I go about showing there is more than one ramification index, such that no prime number that totally ramifies $K/\mathbb{Q}$. </p>

<p>It's trivial to see that if $a$ is irrational, we get no solution. </p>

<p>Thus $a \in \mathbb{Q} \Rightarrow a = \dfrac{p}{q} ~ (*)$ where $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $\gcd(p,q)=1$. Then</p>

<p>By the integer root theorem, for $n$ to be an integer it should be $kq = zn ~ (1)$. Hence </p>

<p>$$\begin{split} \Rightarrow pn^3+6pn^2+8pn-kq=0 &amp;\stackrel{(1)}{\Rightarrow} pn^2+6pn+8p-z=0 \\ &amp;\Rightarrow n = \dfrac{-6p \pm 2\sqrt{p^2+zp}}{2p} \\ &amp;\stackrel{n&gt;0}{\Longrightarrow} n = -3 + \dfrac{\sqrt{p^2+zp}}{p} \in \mathbb{Z}\end{split}$$ </p>

<p>But again for $n$ to be an integer it should be $p^2+zp=p^2m^2 \Rightarrow p = \dfrac{z}{m^2-1} ~(2)$ </p>

<p>By (1) and (2) we get that $$kq=p(m^2-1)n \Rightarrow \dfrac{p}{q} = \dfrac{k}{(m^2-1)n} \stackrel{n=m-3}{\Longrightarrow} \boxed{a = \dfrac{k}{(m-3)(m-1)(m+1)}}$$</p>

<p>We see that if $m$ is a small number (like $2$ and $3$) the equation is satisfied, but for $m$ being a larger number (like $10$)then the initial number is not an integer. Please tell me if I have done anything wrong or if I should add anything to my solution.</p>

<p>I can write the compositum as F = <b>Q</b>[&radic;–1, &radic;2, &radic;3, &radic;5, &radic;7 ...] (can I?) and then the Galois group G = Gal(F/<b>Q</b>)  is isomorphic to a direct product &Pi;<sub>p</sub> (<b>Z</b>/2<b>Z</b>) where the product is taken over all primes p, as well as p=-1, and the pth component is generated by the conjugation &sigma;<sub>p</sub> defined by &radic;p -> –&radic;p.</p>

<p>An example of a subgroup which isn't closed would be the subgroup <strong>H</strong> consisting of <i>finite</i> products of conjugations, since for example, <strong>H</strong> contains the sequence &sigma;<sub>2</sub>, &sigma;<sub>2</sub>&sigma;<sub>3</sub>, &sigma;<sub>2</sub>&sigma;<sub>3</sub>&sigma;<sub>5</sub>, &sigma;<sub>2</sub>&sigma;<sub>3</sub>&sigma;<sub>5</sub>&sigma;<sub>7</sub>... which converges to the automorphism ""conjugate everything"", and this automorphism is not contained in <strong>H</strong>.</p>

<p>However this subgroup is nowhere near being finite index--it has the cardinality of the natural numbers, whereas G has the cardinality of the reals.

The most obvious way of doing this (for the two-dimensional case, say) would seem to be computing the value at some point $(x,y)$ by using $x$, $y$, and the seed parameters as seeds for something like an LFSR generator or a Mersenne Twister, then running the RNG for some fixed number of steps and taking the resultant value as the value of the function at that point.</p>

<p>I want $c = 1$, so how do I proceed from here? How do I apply the procedure iteratively?</p>

$$x^2 + 1 = 97m$$
We find an $x,m$ that solves the equation.
$$x = 75, m = 58$$
Now, we pick an $a,b$ such that $\frac{-m}{2} \leq a,b \leq \frac{m}{2}$
$$a \equiv x \pmod m = 17$$
$$b \equiv y \pmod m = 1$$</p>

<p>Consider a set of $d$-dimensional integer vectors, $z \subset \mathbb{Z}^d$ such that each component $z_i$ is bounded by another integer $K$. Let us denote this set as:</p>

<p>$$Z_K^d = \Big \{ z \in \mathbb{Z}^d ~\big|~ z_i \in \{0,1,\ldots,K \} ~ i = 1,\ldots, d \Big\}$$</p>

<p>We can visualize $Z_K^d$ as the set of integer coordinates within a $d$-dimensional hypercube of size $K+1$. Note that $Z_K^d$ contains $\big|Z_K^d\big| = (K+1)^d$ distinct vectors, as each of its $d$ components can take on $K+1$ values. </p>

<p>I am interested in determining the number of vectors $z \in Z_d^K$ that are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers#Generalizations"" rel=""nofollow"">coprime</a>. Formally, a vector $z \in Z_d^K$ is said to be coprime if the greatest common divisor of all of it's components is 1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers#Properties"" rel=""nofollow"">As explained in the Wiki article</a>, we can also think of these vectors as points with integer coordinates that are 'visible' from the origin (in the sense that there is no other point with integer coordinates between these points and the origin). </p>

<p>Let us denote this subset of coprime vectors $P_K^d \subseteq Z_K^d$ and define it as:</p>

<p>$$P_K^d = \Big \{ z \in Z_K^d ~\big| ~\text{gcd}(z_1,\ldots,z_d)=1 \Big\}$$</p>

<p>I am wondering if there is a <strong>closed-form expression</strong> or a <strong>closed-form upper bound</strong> for the <em>density</em> of these coprime vectors in my original set:</p>

<p>$$\gamma_K^d = \frac{\big|C_K^d\big|}{\big|Z_K^d\big|}$$</p>

<p>Also, I counted the frequency of all the numbers represented. They all have either 1, 2, 3, or 4 instances. The six numbers that have only 1 instance are all squares -- those of 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10. This makes sense -- squares don't fall into that 4x5 = 5x4 redundancy. The 23 numbers with 2 instances are kind of the default I guess. The four with 3 are the remaining squares -- 4, 9, 16, and 36. 4 and 9 make sense to me, as they are squares within the basic range of the times table, so they are hit by themselves, their square root, and 1.

<p>Fill in $d=2$ cause that's the most easy, gives:
$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} -(2)^{2k}k n\ln(2)(-1)^n-(2)^{2k} n\ln(n)(-1)^n$$
$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} -(4)^{k} n\ln(n)(-1)^n=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}  n\ln(n)/3(-1)^n \tag 2$$
$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} -(2)^{2k}k n\ln(2)(-1)^n=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} -\frac{4}{9}n\ln(2)(-1)^n= \frac{1}{9}\ln(2) \tag 3$$</p>

$$(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n*n \ln(n)/3)+\ln(2)/9\approx 0.165421153 \tag 4$$</p>

$$\sum_{n=1}^{m} n \ln(n)=m(m+1)\ln(m+1)/2-(m)(m+2)/4+\ln(m+1)/12+error \tag 5$$

"<p>Today I set out to invent a two character numeral system designed to make factorization trivial. Indeed, it lets one factor non-trivial numbers with over thousand digits within 30 seconds per hand - the upshot is that the notation isn't particularly suited for arithmetic. In fact, when I try to add certain two digit numbers, my computer gives me an overflow warning. </p>

<p>The idea is to not use any base like binary or decimal, as in $28=2\cdot 10^1+8\cdot 10^0$, but to hardcode the prime factors $28=2^2\cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^1$ into the notation. So denote the start and end of a number by ""$s$"" and ""$e$"". I set </p>

<p>$0:=se$</p>

<p>and declare a natural number to be any string of the form ""$sxe$"" where $x$ is a finite string of numbers. The $n$'th number in the sequence $x$ denotes the power oth the $n$'th prime number and ""$sxe$"" is the associated product. So from an ordinal point of view</p>

<p>$1=2^0=s0e=ssee$</p>

<p>$2=2^1=s1e=ssseee$</p>

<p>$3=2^0\cdot 3^1=s01e=ssesseee$</p>

<p>$4=2^2=s2e=sssseeee$</p>

<p>$5=2^0\cdot 3^0\cdot 5^1=s001e=ssesesseee$</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>$28=2^2\cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 \cdot 7^1=s2001e=sssseeesesesseee$</p>

<p>I came to the conclusion that the language consists of all the strings with equal number of $s$'s and $e$'s, where while scanning from the left there are always more $s$'s than $e$'s and the substring $esee$ isn't allowed. The first condition makes sure that all numbers close and the second one disallows superfluous factor of powers of 0.</p>

<p>I've written a script which brute force generates these strings (it forms all permutations of even numbers of $s$'s and $e$'s and then drops the disallowed ones) and also one to translate them to decimal expression (which relies on knowing what the $n$'th prime is):</p>

<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/RwkGX6TV"">http://pastebin.com/RwkGX6TV</a></p>

<p>This e.g tells me that 2417851639229258349412352 is sssesssseeeeee and the nice thing is that all numbers factor easily:</p>

<p>$sssesssseeeeee$ </p>

<p>$= s(s(se)(s(s(s(se)e)e)e)e)e$</p>

<p>$=s(s0(s(s(s0e)e)e)e)e$</p>

<p>$=s(s0(s(s1e)e)e)e$</p>

<p>$=s(s0(s2e)e)e$</p>

<p>$=s(s0(2^2)e)e$</p>

<p>$=s(2^0\cdot 3^{2^2})e$</p>

<p>$=2^{3^{2^2}}.$</p>

<p>For now, I've generated most of the numbers with 20 characters and I've added an artificial bound of $R=10^{50}$ to the size of the exponents. This is necessary, as e.g. the number $13$, being the $6$th prime, reads $ssesesesesesseee$, i.e. $s000001e$ but it's neighbors in this enumeration can be numbers with thousands of digits. Generating the strings is simple down at $14$ but multiplication is hard. Later, also higher number of strings are needed and the way I produce the permutation is probably inefficient. </p>

<p>To generate a bigger library of numbers, I'd like to know if someone has an idea for a less arbitrary enumeration of the the strings which avoid the uncomputably big numbers. </p>

If $n$ be a six digit number formed by the numbers $1,2,3,4,5,6$ such that $n$ is divisible by $5$, then what are the possible remainders if $n$ is divided by $45$.
Now,since $n$ is divisible by $5$ so it must end with $5$ and the remaining five numbers can be arranged in $5!$ ways in five different positions.Now,the important thing that I observe is that most of the numbers leave the remainder $30$ when they are divided by $45$. I use the word 'most' as I have not checked all such numbers.But I don't find suitable reason behind it.Do all these numbers belong to the same remainder class which is $30$. If the answer is 'Yes' then can anybody explain me the actual reason behind it</p>

"<p>What is the largest computable mathematical division in terms of the number of digits that can be handled by a typical desktop computer using the best available big number libraries, assuming input is a decimal string and output is an exact answer?

"<p>I've been trying to see whether following assertion is true in order to give a quick proof of another problem I was doing: if $K$ is a finite dimensional extension of the $p$-adic numbers $\mathbb{Q}_p$, we have the multiplicative field norm $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}_p}: K \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}_p$.  While the norm is not guaranteed to be surjective, is it always possible to find some $k \in K$ such that $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}_p}(k)$ has ($p$-adic) absolute value $1/p$?</p>

<p>One way I would imagine to do this is to show that there exist $\alpha, \beta \in K$ such that $|N(\alpha)| = p^A$ and $|N(\beta)| = p^B$ with $A, B$ relatively prime.  The assertion then follows because there exist integers $x, y$ such that $xA + yB = 1$, whence $\alpha^{-x}\beta^{-y} \in K$ with $|N(\alpha^{-x}\beta^{-y})| = |N(\alpha^{-x})N(\beta^{-y})| = |a|^{-x}|b|^{-y} = p^{-Ax}p^{-By} = 1/p$.  </p>

<p>My claim seems to me altogether reasonable since otherwise there exists some prime $q$ such that the absolute value $p^s$ of every $N(k)$ as $k$ runs through all of $K$ will be such that $s$ is always divisible by $q$, which doesn't seem right.</p>

<p>be the standard resolution. Let $I\subset \mathbb{Z}[G]$ be the ideal generated by elements of the type $(g-1)$. For two $G$-modules $M,N$ the $G$ module structure on $M\otimes N$ is given by $$g\cdot (m\otimes n):=gm\otimes gn.$$</p>

<p>Define 
$$H_i(G,M)=H_i\bigg(\cdots\to \frac{P_2\otimes M}{I(P_2\otimes M)}\to \frac{P_1\otimes M}{I(P_1\otimes M)} \to \frac{P_0\otimes M}{I(P_0\otimes M)}\to 0\bigg).$$</p>

<p>If $$0\to M'\to M\to M''\to 0$$ is a short exact sequence of $G$-modules then we have a short exact sequence of $G$-modules 
$$0\to \frac{P_i\otimes M'}{I(P_i\otimes M')}\to \frac{P_i\otimes M}{I(P_i\otimes M)} \to \frac{P_i\otimes M''}{I(P_i\otimes M'')}\to 0.$$
As a consequence we get a short exact sequence of complexes 
$$0\to \frac{P_\bullet\otimes M'}{I(P_\bullet\otimes M')}\to \frac{P_\bullet\otimes M}{I(P_\bullet\otimes M)} \to \frac{P_\bullet\otimes M''}{I(P_\bullet\otimes M'')}\to 0$$
and consequently a long exact sequence of homology groups. The connecting homomorphism is defined in the usual way; we start with an element in $\frac{P_i\otimes M''}{I(P_i\otimes M'')}$ which is 0 under the differential, lift it to an element in $\frac{P_i\otimes M}{I(P_i\otimes M)}$ and apply the differential to get an element in $\frac{P_{i-1}\otimes M'}{I(P_{i-1}\otimes M')}$, whose homology class is the required element. </p>

<p>Now consider the case when $M=\mathbb{Z}[G]$ and $M''=\mathbb{Z}$, and $\bullet=1$. In this case the connecting homomorphism should give an isomorphism $H_1(G,\mathbb{Z})\to H_0(G,I)$.
Let $\alpha$ be an element in $\frac{P_1}{IP_1}$ whose differential is 0. We can lift this to the element $\alpha\otimes 1$ in $\frac{P_1\otimes \mathbb{Z}[G]}{I(P_1\otimes \mathbb{Z}[G])}$, but now applying the differential, which in this case is $d\otimes 1$, we will always get 0 since $d\alpha=0$, which is clearly not correct.

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that this problem is relatively simple if $w$ is defined over $\mathbb{Z}\backslash \{0\}$ instead of $\mathbb{N}^+$ which is the problem listed in the book. My question is whether the stronger statement above is also true. </p>

<p>My current proof attempt is incomplete.</p>

<p>If $\forall a,\ w(a) = 0$ we are done. Otherwise let $n$ be the least number s.t. $w(n) \neq 0$. Easy to show from (1) that $n \neq 1$ since $w(1) = 0$ and that $n$ is prime.</p>

<p>By unique factorisation theorem and (1) to get the result I need only prove that for all primes $p$, $p\neq n \implies w(p) = 0$.</p>

<p>I tried to proceed using well founded induction. If $p \lt n$ done. Otherwise $p \gt n$. If $n \gt 2$ then $n, p$ are odd and $n+p$ is even hence $n+p=2q$. Now $n \nmid p$ so $n \nmid n + p$. If $n \gt 2$ we have $n \nmid q$. Since $q \lt p$ the induction hypothesis gives us $w(q) = 0$ and since $n \gt 2$, $w(2) = 0$. Thus $w(n+p) = w(2q) = w(2) + w(q) = 0 \ge \min(w(n), w(p))$. This gives us that $w(p) = 0$. </p>

<p>I can't see how to solve the $n=2$ case. Is the case where $n=2$ solvable or is there a counterexample? </p>

<p>Some perhaps useful facts. </p>

<p>If $w(2) \neq 0$ and any other $w(p')=0$ for $p'$ prime, $p'\neq 2$ then $w(p) =0$ for all primes $p\neq2$. Easy to prove since every prime $p$ is an even multiple less than some power $r$ of $p'$ and by (1) $w(p^r) = 0$ and then by (2) $w(p) = 0$.</p>

<p>It can't be the case that $w$ behaves identically on all primes, i.e. $w(p) = k$ for all primes $p$ since it is easy to compute counterexamples, e.g. $2^2*5^2 + 3^5 = 7^3$ that will contradict (2).</p>

<p>Thus it must be distinct at some two primes $p_1, p_2$. This gives two distinct relatively prime numbers where w is equal, $ p_1^{w(p_2)} $ and $p_2^{w(p_1)}$. I hoped that this would lead to a contradiction but haven't found a way forward yet.</p>

"<p>In 1893 Hadamard proved that:</p>

<p>$$\xi(s) = \xi(0) \prod_{\rho} \left(1- \frac{s}{\rho} \right) \left(1- \frac{s}{1-\rho} \right)$$</p>

<p>where $\xi(z) = \frac12 z(z-1) \pi^{-\frac{z}{2}} \Gamma(\frac{z}{2}) \zeta(z)$ and $\rho = \sigma + \gamma i$ is a non-trivial zero of $\zeta(s)$ (i.e. $\gamma_n$ is the imaginary part of the n-th $\rho)$).</p>

<p>Riemann had already conjectured this in 1859 and since he needed an 'always real' function for his next thought steps, he assumed $s=\frac12 + t i$ and defined the function $\Xi(t)=\xi(s)$ that has been proven to be equal to:</p>

<p>$$\Xi(t)= \Xi(0)\prod_\gamma\left(1-\frac{t^2}{\gamma^2}\right)$$</p>

<p>It is known that $\xi(s)=\xi(1-s)$ and $\xi(s)=\overline{\xi(\overline{s})}$ and this implies that $\xi(s)\xi(\overline{s})$ must be real. Also known is that when there is a non-trivial zero $\rho$ lying off the critical line, then also $1-\rho, \overline{\rho}, \overline{1-\rho}$ must be zeros and their product will always be real:</p>

<p>$$\displaystyle\prod_\gamma\left(1-\frac{s}{\sigma+i \gamma}\right)
\left(1-\frac{s}{\sigma-i \gamma}\right)\left(1-\frac{s}{1-(\sigma+i \gamma)}\right)
\left(1-\frac{s}{\overline{1-(\sigma+i \gamma)}}\right)$$</p>

<p>This brought me to the following conjecture. Suppose $s=a+t i$ and $\Xi_a(t)=\xi(s)$ so $\Xi_a(0)=\xi(a)$, then the following product holds and is always real:</p>

<p>$$\Xi_a(t)\Xi_a(-t) = \Xi_a(0)^2\prod_\gamma \left(1-\frac{t^2}{\gamma^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{(-t)^2}{\gamma^2}\right)$$</p>

<p>or simpler:</p>

<p>$$\Xi_a(t)\Xi_a(-t) = \left(\xi(a)\prod_\gamma \left(1-\frac{t^2}{\gamma^2}\right)\right)^2$$</p>

<p>Numerical tests indicate that the conjecture is correct, but I am obvioulsy keen to find a proof (I do realise this is a way too big of a question to ask here!). Does anybody have a link that explains how $\Xi(t)= \Xi(0)\prod_\gamma\left(1-\frac{t^2}{\gamma^2}\right)$ has been derived?

<hr>
Consider the divergent series 
$$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty {(-1)^{k-1} \over k }\zeta(-k) \underset{\mathcal N}{=} s_1 = -0.081061466...   $$
Here the symbol ""$\underset{\mathcal N}{=} $"" means, that I did that sum by the Noerlund-summation-method using 64 terms. The value which I expect by some other derivation which I'll explain below is $ -\zeta(0)' = 0.91893853 $ which differs exactly by 1.        </p>

<p>More context: the coefficients at the zetas are taken just from the matrix of Stirling-numbers of the first kind, denote them simply as $s1_{r,c}$ , so the defition stems really from:
$$ \sum_{r=1}^\infty s1_{r,1} \cdot {1! \over r! }\zeta(-r) \underset{\mathcal N}{=} s_1  $$</p>

<p><hr>
Next consider the divergent series taken from the next column in the Stirling matrix:
$$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty s1_{k,2} \cdot { 2! \over k! }\zeta(-k) \underset{\mathcal N}{=} s_2 = -0.006356455...   $$
The value which I expect by the other derivation is $ \zeta(0)'' = -2.00635645591... $ which differs (relatively near) by $2!$. (The difference can be made smaller by taking more terms for the Noerlund-summation)
<hr>
To make things short, I'm doing the dotproduct
$$ Z \cdot S1 \underset{\mathcal N}{=} Y $$
where the infinite rowvector $Z$ contains the consecutive zetas $\zeta(0),\zeta(-1),\zeta(-2), ...$ and $S1$ is the matrix containing the Stirlingnumbers first kind, scaled by factorials such that
$$ S1_{r,c} = s1_{r,c} \cdot { c!\over r!} $$
getting the result-vector $Y$ which deviates from my expected result of derivatives  $ \zeta(0)^{(c)}$ by factorials such that
$$ Y[c]= (-1)^c \cdot (\zeta(0)^{(c)} + c!) $$
<hr>
The problem is connected with that of the Ramanujan-summation of the series of like powers of logarithms:
$$ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \log(1+k)^c \underset{\mathcal Z}{=}  (-1)^c \cdot \zeta(0)^{(c)} $$
where I get (by ""$\mathcal  Z $"" eta-regularization) the ""magic constants"" having the same values as I described above and which deviate by the expected values for that sums (by the signed $\zeta(0)$-derivatives) exactly the factorials. (See <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/39378/series-of-logarithms-sum-limits-k-1-infty-lnk-ramanujan-summation?rq=1"">my earlier question in MSE</a> but in which I had not yet that more general view with the columns of the Stirlingmatrix)           </p>

Any hint, complete proof, reference, etc. is much appreciated. </p>

<p>EDIT : presenting my proof as @AndréNicolas requested : I just followed the same steps; let's assume the series is $s$. Now choose $k_0$ such that $m^{k_0^2} &gt; q$. Define $x = q m^{k_0^2} \left(s - \sum_{k=1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}} \right)$. Now if $s$ is not irrational then $s=\frac{p}{q}$ for some non-negative $p$ and $q$. Then it is easy to check that $x$ is an integer. Now we need to reach to a contradiction by proving that $x &lt; 1$. 
After simple manipulations, $x = q m^{k_0^2} \sum_{k=k_0+1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}}$
Now, for $k=k_0+1,k_0+2, \ldots$, we have $k^2 &gt; k+k_0^2$ so
$$ q m^{k_0^2} \sum_{k=k_0+1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k^2}}} &lt; q m^{k_0^2} \sum_{k=k_0+1}^{k_0}{\frac{1}{m^{k+k_0^2}}} = \frac{q}{m^{k_0^2+1}}\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{m}}=\frac{1}{m-1}$$ which follows from our assumption about $q$ and $k_0$.</p>

"<p><code>Legendre</code>, <code>Jacobi</code> and <code>Kronecker</code> Symbols are powerful multiplicative functions in computational number theory. They are useful mathematical tools, essentially for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test"" rel=""nofollow"">primality testing</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization"" rel=""nofollow"">integer factorization</a>; these in turn are important in cryptography.</p>

<p>Yet, it would be nice to have a discussion here on their use in classical number theory and math problems. In other words, what kind of problems can they be effectively applied to? Or simply, when/where to use them?</p>

<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>

<p>For any integer $a$ and any positive odd integer $n$ the <code>Jacobi</code> symbol is defined as the product of the <code>Legendre</code> symbols corresponding to the prime factors of $n$:</p>

<p>$\left(\tfrac{a}{p}\right)$ represents the <code>Legendre</code> symbol, defined for all integers $a$ and all odd primes $p$ by
$$\Bigg(\frac{a}{n}\Bigg) = \left(\frac{a}{p_1}\right)^{\alpha_1}\left(\frac{a}{p_2}\right)^{\alpha_2}\cdots \left(\frac{a}{p_k}\right)^{\alpha_k}\mbox{ where } n=p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}.$$
$$
\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) = \left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
0 &amp; \text{if } a \equiv 0 \pmod{p},\\
1 &amp; \text{if } a \not\equiv 0\pmod{p} \text{ and for some integer } x:\;a\equiv x^2\pmod{p},\\
-1 &amp; \text{if } a \not\equiv 0\pmod{p} \text{ and there is no such } x.
\end{array}
\right.
$$ 
Following the normal convention for the empty product, $\left(\tfrac{a}{1}\right) = 1$. The <code>Legendre</code> and <code>Jacobi</code> symbols are indistinguishable exactly when the lower argument is an odd prime, in which case they have the same value.</p>

<p>The <code>Kronecker</code> symbol, written as $\left(\frac an\right)$ or $(a|n)$, is an extension of the <code>Jacobi</code> symbol to all integers.</p>

<p>Let $n$ be a non-zero integer, with prime factorization </p>

<p>$$n=u \cdot p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_k^{e_k},$$</p>

<p>where $u$ is a unit (i.e., $u=\pm1$), and the $p_i$ are primes. Let $a$ be an integer. The <code>Kronecker</code> symbol $(a|n)$ is defined by </p>

<p>$$ \left(\frac{a}{n}\right) = \left(\frac{a}{u}\right) \prod_{i=1}^k \left(\frac{a}{p_i}\right)^{e_i}. $$</p>

<p>For odd number $p_i$, the number $(a|p_i)$ is simply the usual <code>Legendre</code> symbol. This leaves the case when $p_i=2$. We define $(a|2)$ by </p>

<p>$$ \left(\frac{a}{2}\right) = 
\begin{cases}
 0 &amp; \mbox{if }a\mbox{ is even,} \\
 1 &amp; \mbox{if } a \equiv \pm1 \pmod{8},  \\
-1 &amp; \mbox{if } a \equiv \pm3 \pmod{8}.
\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>Since it extends the <code>Jacobi</code> symbol, the quantity $(a|u)$ is simply $1$ when $u=1$. When $u=-1$, we define it by</p>

<p>$$ \left(\frac{a}{-1}\right) = \begin{cases} -1 &amp; \mbox{if }a &lt; 0, \\ 1 &amp; \mbox{if } a \ge 0. \end{cases} $$</p>

<p>Finally, we put</p>

<p>$$\left(\frac a0\right)=\begin{cases}1&amp;\text{if }a=\pm1,\\0&amp;\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>These extensions suffice to define the <code>Kronecker</code> symbol for all integer values $a,n$.</p>

<p>The customer don't leave the table unless they are politely requested to do so. And customers can order meal later again. So if they were already having a table, they can be served on the same table [John doesn't have to clean]. But if they don't have a table then they must be given some table [John must clean]</p>

<p><strong>Problem :</strong> </p>

<p>The restaurant has N tables. When a customer requires a table, he/she can occupy any unoccupied table. However if all tables are occupied, then John is free to ask politely any customer to leave his/her table. And the freed table can be given to the waiting customer.</p>

<p><strong>Now Given the  list telling the order of customer meal requests for the entire day,

<p><strong>Explanation :</strong> In the starting all tables i.e. 2 tables are unoccupied. 
When customer 1 asks for table, he can be given any of the 2 tables. 
John has to clean either of the table. Next customer 2 can occupy the other free table. John must clean second time. When customer 3 comes John can ask either customer 1 or 2 to leave.

In either case He will have to clean the table for the fourth time.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Let N=3 and M=5 and list be [1 2 1 3 4]</p>

For reasonably small $\varepsilon$ this looks like the coordinate axes ""thickened"" somewhat. We are interested in the translates of $K$, with the convention that if a part of the translate $K$ ""sticks out"" of $T^2$ it gets ""wrapped around"" on the opposite side; thus $(x,y) \in K + (a,b)$ iff $(x,y) \equiv (x'+a,y'+b) \pmod{1}$ for some $(x',y') \in K$. The task is now to cover $T^2$ using as few crosses as possible. It is fairly obvious that the exact number cannot be found, so I am only asking for the asymptotics of this number for sufficiently small $\varepsilon$. </p>

<p>The obvious attempt is to find a suitable rectangle contained in a cross, and use these rectangles to cover the square. One can easily find rectangles of area $\Theta(\varepsilon)$ (i.e. $C \varepsilon$ for a universal constant), so one can cover the square with $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$ crosses. The area of the largest convex figure that fits into a cross is $\Theta(\varepsilon)$, so this cannot be significantly improved without new insight.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the area of a cross is $\Theta(\varepsilon \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. Thus, one needs at least $\Theta(1/\varepsilon \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ crosses for a cover.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the two bounds do not agree. Ideally, I would like to know (asymptotically) what's the least cardinality of a cover. More realistically, I would appreciate any argument showing that either of the bounds can be improved.</p>

<p><em>Motivation: The problem came up when I was considering recurrence rates of generalised polynomials. It is related to asking for an upper bound on the least positive integer $n$ so that $\left&lt; n \alpha \right&gt; \left&lt;n \beta \right&gt; \in (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)$, where the brackets indicate the fractional part.</em></p>

"<p>Let $a, m$ be positive integers and $m &gt; 1$. I'm interested in the sequence $(a^k)_{k 
\in \mathbb{N_0}} \mod m$. Since there are only $m$ different values that can occur in the sequence and since $a^k = a \cdot a^{k-1}\ \ \forall k &gt; 0$ is only dependent on the previous element, I conclude that there exist $i, C \leq m$, such that $a^{k + C} = a^k\ \ \forall k \geq i$.</p>

<p>Example: $a = 2, m = 12$, we get the sequence $1, 2, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8... \mod 12$ with $x = 2, C = 2$.</p>

<p>Given $a$ and $m$, I want to algorithmically find some $i$ and $C$ with the above property. I'm especially interested in the case where $gcd(a,m) \neq 1$, since otherwise a trivial solution is $i = 0, C = \phi(m)$ according to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">Euler's theorem</a>, if I'm not mistaken. The obvious algorithm is naive in that it just evaluates the sequence element by element and stops as soon as it hits a duplicate. I'm sure we can do better than $O(m)$ exponentiations by using the Chinese Remainder Theorem and factorizing $m$ or something, but since I don't have a math background it's a bit hard for me to put my finger on it.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal is to evaluate ""exponential-tower""-type expressions of the form ${a_1}^{{a_2}^{a_3^{a_4^{\ldots}}}}$ modulo some prime $p$, as asked in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21367824/how-to-compute-an-exponential-tower-modulo-a-prime/21368784#21368784"">an algorithm question on Stack Overflow</a> I tried to contribute my two cents there by applying some observations, but I'm personally interested in this problem and pretty sure the algorithm can be improved if we can solve the particular problem of finding the cycle length faster.</p>

"<p>This is a pet idea of mine which I thought I'd share.  Fix a prime $q$ congruent to $1 \bmod 4$ and define a sequence $F_n$ by $F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1$, and</p>

<p>$\displaystyle F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + \frac{q-1}{4} F_n.$</p>

<p>Then $F_n = \frac{\alpha^n - \beta^n}{\alpha - \beta}$ where $\alpha, \beta$ are the two roots of $f(x) = x^2 - x - \frac{q-1}{4}$.  When $q = 5$ we recover the ordinary Fibonacci numbers.  The discriminant of $f(x)$ is $q$, so it splits $\bmod p$ if and only if $q$ is a quadratic residue $\bmod p$.  </p>

<p>If $\left( \frac{q}{p} \right) = -1$, then the Frobenius morphism $x \mapsto x^p$ swaps $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (working over $\mathbb{F}_p$), hence $F_p \equiv -1 \bmod p$.

"<p>Is there an extant published expository account, comprehensible to all mathematicians, of the conceptual differences between ancient Greek mathematical concepts and modern ones?</p>

<p>I have in mind things like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Euclid (I'll need to look between the covers of a book to be sure whether this is right&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.) didn't know how to multiply more than three numbers because no more than three lines can be mutually orthogonal; but he did know how to find the smallest number measured by more than three numbers (what today we would call the LCM);</li>
<li>Consequently (?) he didn't know about factoring numbers into primes (for example, $90= 2\cdot3\cdot3\cdot5$ is not the LCM of its prime factors) (and that's why he stopped short of stating, let alone proving, the uniqueness of prime factorizations), but of course they did know that every number is ""measured by"" at least one prime number;</li>
<li>(Maybe?) Euclid did not consider $1$ to be a number;</li>
<li>The ancient Greeks had no concept of real number.  They had a concept of congruence of line segments, so that they could say that one line segment goes into another between $6$ and $7$ times, and the remainder goes into the shorter segment between $2$ and $3$ times, etc. etc., so they knew what it meant to say the ratio of the length of segment A to that of segment B is the same as the ratio of the length of segment C to segment D.  They even knew what it means to say the ratio of lengths A to B is the same as the ratio of areas E to F, and similarly volumes.  But they did not make the mistake of knowing whether a particular area is less than a particular length.  Modern mathematicians seem to make that mistake by saying those are real numbers; I think modern physicists may avoid that error.</li>
<li>They did not have a concept of irrational number (since they didn't have a concept of real number), but they knew what it meant to say that two line segments <b>have no common measure</b>, and how to prove it in some cases (e.g. no segment can be laid end-to-end some number (=&nbsp;cardinality) of times to make the length of the side of a square and some other number of times to make the diagonal).</li>

<p>I am interested if anybody knows any results for raising numbers to irrational powers.  </p>

<p>For instance, we can easily show that there exists an irrational number raised to an irrational power such that the result is a rational number. Observe ${\sqrt 2 ^ {\sqrt 2}}$. Since we do not know if ${\sqrt 2 ^ {\sqrt 2}}$ is rational or not, there are two cases.  </p>

<br/>I was trying to solve this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $G$ be a finite abelian group of order $n$ for which the number of solutions of $x^m=e$ is at most $m$ for any $m$ dividing $n$. Prove that $G$ must be cyclic. [Hint:Let $\psi (m)$ be the number of elements in $G$ of order $m$. Show that $\psi (m)\leq \phi (m)$, and use $n=\Sigma_{m\mid n}\phi (m) $] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I have proven is that $\Sigma_{d|n}(ψ(d)−ϕ(d))=0$, then if the statement in the hint holds, ψ(d)=ϕ(d) for every d|n. n divides itself, therefore, $\psi (n)=ϕ(n)≠0$. Therefore G admits a generator, and we'll be done.The problem is to prove the statement in the hint. Yet I have conluded a different seemingly contradictory result, which doesn't help solve the problem at all, since it could be that $ψ(n)=0,ψ(n)−ψ(d)&lt;0$ and $ψ(d)−ϕ(d)&gt;0$ for some $d≠n$. Of course I don't know how to show that $\psi (m)\leq \phi (m)$, and here is how I got this contradiction:
<br/>If $\psi (m)\neq 0$, then let $m\neq 1,m\mid n$. Consider an element $a\in G,|a|=m$. Within its cyclic group, there will be $\phi (m)$ elements with order $m$ since any element $a^i$ in it is a generator if and only if $\gcd(m,i)=1$. Therefore $\psi(m) \geq \phi (m)$ since some element out side the cyclic group may have order $m$ too.
<br/>If this reasoning is correct, I think it will contradict with the fact in the hint which is $\phi(m) \geq \phi(m)$. The number of solutions is $\Sigma_{d|m}\psi (d)$, which is always greater than $\psi (m)$. So no matter how great $\psi (m)$ is, or how $\psi (m) &gt;\phi (m)$, the number of solution may still be less than $m$. What's going wrong? How to prove the statment in the hint? Help me please. Also I have read through <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/50791/if-xm-e-has-at-most-m-solutions-for-any-m-in-mathbbn-then-g-is-cycl"">If $x^m=e$ has at most $m$ solutions for any $m\in \mathbb{N}$, then $G$ is cyclic</a>, but for the accepted answer, it doesn't show how to prove the fact in the hint, and other answers do not use the fact in the hint.</p>

<p>In my case I found more than $100$ vectors with the size of $30+$ digits each, when multiplying them I get a number that got too many digits, so squaring it becomes a problem, it takes more time than solving the matrix itself(I use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method"" rel=""nofollow"">babylon method</a> for squaring).</p>

"<p>I'll try to format my question in a manner such that you can skip (irrelevant) parts.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Find all natural $n$ such that $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$ is prime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p>

<p>I'm trying to prepare talented elementary school children for mathematics competition and the question from the title popped up somewhere as suggested for the purpose (explicitly stating this should be number theory exercise for elementary school). Now, this immediately rang some alarms, as powers are learned in grade 8 (final grade before high school), when they certainly don't know any modular arithmetic or induction, let alone more advanced number theory. I tried to solve it anyway to see if this could actually be used, but to my surprise, I couldn't. Obviously, when $n=1$ we get $17$, which is prime, but for $n&gt;1$ it seems that it will never be prime again, although I fail to show it (computer says that the expression is never prime in range $n\in[2, 100000000]$). There is, of course, possibility of a typo in question, but computer check up makes me believe that this is ""legit"" question.</p>

<p><strong>My work:</strong></p>

<p>First of all, for $n=1$ we have $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n = 17$ which is prime.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is easy enough to check that for $n = 2k,\ k\in\mathbb N$ we have $5\mid 3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$.</p>

<p>This looked promising, but for $n = 5$, we get $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n = 211\cdot 857$ as prime decomposition which is definitely worrisome.</p>

<p>I tried to find some appropriate $d\in\mathbb N$ such that $n = qd + r$ to build some casework with respect to $r$, but had no luck.</p>

<p>What I did notice is that if you pick $n$ in some non-trivial ideal $(d)$, there is at least one prime $p_d$ such that $p_d\mid 3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$, for all $n\in (d)$. </p>

<p><em>(though, I proved this only for $d=2$, for $d&gt;2$ this is but a computer inspired conjecture)</em></p>

<p>Here is a table:</p>

<p>\begin{array}{c | c}
d &amp; p_d \\ \hline
2 &amp; 5 \\
3 &amp; 19 \\
4 &amp; 5, 13 \\
5 &amp; 211 \\
6 &amp; 5, 7, 19 \\
7 &amp; 29, 71 \\
8 &amp; 5, 13, 97 \\
9 &amp; 19, 1009 \\
10 &amp; 5, 11, 211\\
\end{array}</p>

<p>Another attempt was obviously to try to factor $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$ directly. Some obvious attempts led me to believe this approach might fail too. Indeed, polynomials $$x^{2n+1} - y^{2n+2} + x^ny^n,$$ $$x^{2n+1} - (x-1)^{2n+2} + x^n(x-1)^n$$ and $$x^{2n+1} - (x+1)^{n+1} + x^n(x-1)^n$$ are irreducible over $\mathbb Q$.</p>

<p>This leaves me without ideas. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

The book states that the new heuristic leads us to expects that the strong Cramér's conjecture $$\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{(\log p_n)^2}=1$$ (which is derived in <a href=""http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa2/aa212.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this paper by Cramer</a>) is false and should be replaced by $$\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{(\log p_n)^2}=2\mathrm e^{-\gamma}$$ where $p_n$ denotes the $n^{th}$ prime number, and $\gamma$ denotes Euler's constant.
