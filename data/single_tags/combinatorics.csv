"<p>A graph property is <em>hereditary</em> if it is closed under taking induced subgraphs (equivalently, if it is closed under removing vertices).  A graph property is <em>monotone</em> if it is closed under taking subgraphs.  (Note that ""monotone"" is sometimes used in different ways from what I've just written.)  Thus, every monotone property is hereditary (but not conversely).  Every monotone property can be characterized by a set of forbidden subgraphs, and every hereditary property can be characterized by a set of forbidden induced subgraphs.  (In each case, the set of forbidden graphs may be infinite.)</p>

<p>Given a (monotone or hereditary) property $\mathcal{P}$, it's easy to define a set $\mathcal{F}$ of forbidden subgraphs (or forbidden induced subgraphs): if $\mathcal{U}$ is the set of all finite unlabeled graphs, set $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{U} \setminus \mathcal{P}$.  However, this is not very useful.  Many hereditary properties can be characterized by simpler set of forbidden subgraphs: for example, perfect graphs are exactly the graphs with no induced $C_{2k+1}$ or $\overline{C_{2k+1}}$ for any $k \geq 2$.</p>

<p>However, I'm having a harder time coming up with examples of monotone properties that have ""non-trivial"" characterizations in terms of forbidden subgraphs.  Of course, for any graph $H$, the class of $H$-free graphs is trivially characterized by taking $\mathcal{F} = \{H\}$.

<p>$\bf Question.$
Fix n. We are interested in the biggest t for which there exist two families of functions, $P_i,Q_i$, of size t from [n] to [n] such that for any $i,j$ whenever we consider the infinite sequence $P_i(Q_j(P_i(Q_j\ldots P_i(3))\ldots)$ (where the number of iterations tends to infinity), it contains no 2's and infinitely many 1's if $i=j$ and it contains no 1's and infinitely many 2's if $i\ne j$.</p>

<p>$\bf A lower bound.$
I know a construction that shows that $t\ge 2^{\frac n2-O(1)}.$ For every subset $S$ of [n] that contains exactly one of $2k$ and $2k+1$ for $2\le k\le \frac n2-2$ we construct a pair of functions, $P_S,Q_S$ as follows. For any number m denote by $m^+$ the smallest element of $S$ that is bigger than m or if all elements of $S$ are at most m then define it to be 1.
$P_S(1)=1, P_S(2)=2$ and for bigger $m$'s $P_S(m)=m^+$, while $Q_S(1)=1, Q_S(2)=2$ and for bigger $m$'s $Q_S(m)=m$ if $m\in S$ and $Q_S(m)=2$ if $m\notin S$. This way we go through all the elements of S and end in 1 if the functions have the same index, but we are pushed to 2 if they differ.</p>

<p>To make this post more educational, I will define these polynomials a bit. Consider the 2-parameter family of Macdonald operators (indexed by powers of the indeterminate $X$) for root system $A_n$, on a symmetric polynomial $f$ with $x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$:</p>

<p>$$D(X;t,q) = a_\delta(x)^{-1} \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \epsilon(\sigma) x^{\sigma \delta}\prod_{i=1}^n (1 + X t^{(\sigma \delta)_i} T_i),$$</p>

<p>(mathoverflow doesn't seem to parse $T_{q,x_i}$ in the formula above, so I had to use the shorter symbol $T_i$, which depends on q).</p>

<p>where $\delta$ is the partition $(n-1,n-2,\ldots, 1,0)$, $a_\delta(x) = \prod_{1 \le i &lt; j \le n} (x_i - x_j)$ is the Vandermonde determinant (in general $a_\lambda(x)$ is the determinant of the matrix $(a_i^{\lambda_j})_{i,j \in [n]}$). </p>

<p>$x^{\sigma \delta}$ means $x_1^{(\sigma \delta)_1} x_2^{(\sigma \delta)_2} \ldots x_n^{(\sigma \delta)_n}$.</p>

<p>Also $(\sigma \delta)_i$ denotes the $\sigma(i)$-th component of $\delta$, namely $n-i$. </p>

<p>Finally the translation operator $T_i = T_{q,x_i}$ is defined as
$$ T_{q,x_i}f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = f(x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}, q x_i , x_{i+1} ,\ldots, x_n).$$</p>

<p>I like to think of the translation operator as the quantized version of the differential operator $I + \partial_i$, where $q-1$ is analogous to the Planck constant(?). </p>

<p>If we write $D(X;q,t) = \sum_{r=0}^n D_{n-r}(q,t) X^r$, then 
Macdonald polynomials $p_\lambda(q,t)$ are simply simultaneous eigenfunctions of these operators. When $q=t$ they become Schur polynomials, defined by $s_\lambda = a_{\delta  +\lambda} / a_\delta$. When $q= t^\alpha$ and $t \to 1$, we get Jack symmetric polymomials, which are eigenfunctions of a Metropolis random walk on the set of all partitions that converge to the so-called Ewens sampling measure, which assigns probability proportional $\alpha^{\ell(\lambda)} z_\lambda^{-1}$. When $q = 0$, they become the Hall-Littlewood polynomials and when $t=1$ they become the monomial symmetric polynomials etc. </p>

<p>I was told repeatedly by experts that Macdonald polynomials exhaust all previous symmetric polynomial bases in some sense. Does anyone know a theorem that says that every family of symmetric polynomial under some conditions can be obtained from Macdonald polynomials by specializing the $q$ and $t$? </p>

  vanishes for all $k$ outside of some finite interval.</li>
  <li>Divide through by the right hand side, so the identity that you wish to prove
  now reads as $\sum_k F (n, k) = 1$, where $F (n, k) = t(n, k)/rhs(n)$.</li>
  <li>Let $R(n, k)$ be the rational function that the WZ method provides as the proof
  of your identity (this is described in Chapter 7 of ""A=B""). Define a
  new function $G(n, k) = R(n, k)F (n, k).$</li>
  <li>You will now observe that the equation
                   $$F (n + 1, k) − F (n, k) = G(n, k + 1) − G(n, k)$$
  is true. Sum that equation over all integers $k$, and note that the right side
  telescopes to 0. The result is that
                             $$\sum_k F (n + 1, k) =    \sum_k F (n, k),$$
  hence we have shown that         $\sum_k F (n, k)$ is independent of $n$, i.e., is constant.         </li>

So this got me thinking, is there a general class of pairs of functions $F,G$ where this algorithm works when you sort according to $a/b$, or perhaps where you sort pairs according to $H(a,b)$ where $H$ depends on $F$ and $G$? I know that for arbitrary positive strictly increasing $F,G$ (i.e. $F,G$ are part of the input, even if given by a finite description instead of an oracle) the optimization problem is NP-hard because you can reduce the subset-sum problem to it.

<p>I am wondering whether there is a substantial change if we require the trees to intersect <em>every</em> axis-parallel unit square contained in the big $n\times n$ square, not only lattice squares.

<p>where each 'X' denotes a base tree, so diagonally adjacent such cells have a common vertice. (Think of the space-filling ""X-fractal"" obtained by iterating this pattern in the obvious way.) Such a tree contains each lattice point, i.e. all corners of the $n\times n$ lattice squares, thus it intersects each unit square.  </p>

"<p>Consider the following one-dimensional version of the game battleships.  There is a battleship somewhere on $\mathbb N$, i.e., a interval $N,\ldots,N+k$.  Your task is to find whether this battleship lies in the interval $1,\ldots,n$ using the minimal number of tests (on can ask if the battlship includes $i$ for any $1\leq i \leq n$). One does not know the value of $k$ (nor a bound on it).  The battleship may not be in the test interval at all.</p>

<p>Intuitively I think that one choses a permutation of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ so that after testing the first $m$, the remaining intervals of untested points in $1,\ldots,n$ are as small as possible.  Example: if $n=5$ then $1,5,3,2,4$ would give an optimal strategy, as would $5,1,3,2,4$.  </p>

<ul>
<li>maintain a sorted list of intervals, put $[2,n-1]$ in it</li>
<li>maintain a results array and put $1$ and $n$ on it</li>
<li>pop the largest interval from the sorted list, divide into two, push the division point onto the results array, push the divided intervals into the sorted list if they are not singletons</li>

<p>Motivation:  This arises in a non-convex global optimisation code which uses a ""subdivide and reject"" method.  The battleship is a region around the global maximum, the tests are (rather expensive) function evaluations.  If the global maximum is in the region of interest I must subdivide, if not then I can reject.  Obviously I want to find whether the global maximum is in the region as soon as possible, since this saves me function evaluations.</p>

<p>Thank you for the replies.  I think that Douglas Zare's answer points in the right direction. After testing the end points one knows that the target is in the interior of the region (if it is there at all).  Then the uniform insertion strategy seems to be the best one (possibly some chages will be needed to handle the integer location of the samples, but I don't think this is a big deal).</p>

<p>Incidentally, I just tested the simple strategy $1,n,2,\ldots,n-1$ on my code (i.e., test the end points, then the interior) and it gives a 2% reduction in evaluations --- well worth having. I will post the improvement with uniform insertion here when it is implemented. </p>

"<p>First I'll phrase the question as a riddle, and than as a general math problem. </p>

<p>We have 12 lettered vases $(A,B,...,L)$, in each vase there are 30 numbered balls (1-30). In each ball there is some random amount of money between 1-1000 dollars (the distribution of the money in the balls is some IID). Now we have two options:</p>

<p>1) We can ask which number (1-30) contains in average the largest amount of money, and than we get 12 balls of that number, we open them all and we take the ball with the highest amount of the 12.</p>

<p>2) We can ask which vase (A-L) contains the largest sum of money, and than we get 30 balls from that vase, we open them all and we take the ball with the highest amount of the 30.</p>

<p>What is the better strategy, assuming that we want a lot of money...</p>

<p>Now to phrase it more generally:</p>

<p>Let  $ A \in\mathbb{N}^{m\times n} , n&gt;m$,</p>

<p>Let $x_{ij}$ be i.i.d. (real) random variables with mean 0 and variance 1</p>

<p>Let $X_1=\max_{1\leq i\leq m}{\sum_{1\leq j\leq n}a_{ij}}$</p>

<p>and let $X_2=\max_{1\leq j\leq n}{\sum_{1\leq i\leq m}a_{ij}}$</p>

<p>What is larger (in average, or the expected value of) $X_1$ or $X_2$?
That is, what we should take first, the maximum value of the rows and than the highest value in that row, or the maximum value of the columns and than the highest value in that column?</p>

<p><strong>Another question</strong> (more combinatorial): We can ask in a case where all of the values in the matrix are different and between 1 to $m\cdot n$. So we have a pure combinatorial question about the possible $m\cdot n!$ permutations of the numbers in the matrix.</p>

<p>The riddle is of course like this:</p>

<p>Let  $ A \in\mathbb{N}^{12\times 30}$ ,$1\leq a_{ij} \leq 1000$ (by i.i.d distibution)</p>

<p>Let $X_1=\max_{1\leq i\leq 12}{\sum_{1\leq j\leq 30}a_{ij}}$ (Option 1)</p>

<p>and let $X_2=\max_{1\leq j\leq 30}{\sum_{1\leq i\leq 12}a_{ij}}$ (Option 2)</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Let $a(n)$ be the greatest order of the automorphism group of a 3-connected cubic graph with $n$ vertices.  Find a good upper bound on $a(n)$.</p>

<p>There is a <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608645"" rel=""nofollow"">paper of Opstall and Veliche</a> that finds the maximum over all cubic graphs, but the maximum occurs for graphs very far from being 3-connected.</p>

<p>When $n$ is a multiple of 4 there is a vertex-transitive cubic graph achieving half the conjectured bound, so if true the bound is pretty sharp.</p>

<p>The maximum does not always occur for vertex-transitive graphs. There is no vertex-transitive counterexample to the conjecture with less than 1000 vertices.</p>

<p>Any bound for which the exponential part is $2^{cn}$ for $c&lt;\frac12$ is potentially useful.</p>

"<p>The short version of this question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $G$ is a graph whose nodes are associated with squares of a chessboard, such that no two nodes in the same row or column of the board are adjacent, we want to associate rooks with the vertices of $G$, such that at most one rook appears in each row and column of the chessboard under the constraint that the vertices containing the rooks induce a connected subgraph of $G$ (thus, the rooks are connected to each other with a lifeline, or lifegraph if you want to be specific).</p>
  
  <p>A <em>maximal</em> configuration of rooks is such that no rooks can be added to the chessboard without violating the constraint that each column/row contain only one rook.</p>
  
  <p><em>Question</em>: A back-tracking depth first search will find all maximal configutions. Will a back-tracking breadth-first search do the same?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's consider an $m \times n$ chessboard that will be inhabited by rooks. As is usual with chess problems in graph theory, each square is represented by a vertex: let $v_{s,t}$ represent the square at row $s$ and column $t$ of the board. Now, let $G$ be an arbitrary graph on the set of vertices $V$ that comprise the squares of the chessboard.</p>

<p>We want to fill the chessboard with rooks (said another way: we want to associate rooks with vertices), such that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every row and every column contain at most one rook (more formally, if a rook is associated with a vertex $v_{i,j}$, then no rook will be associated with $v_{i,s}$ for $s \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$) or $v_{t,j}$ for $t \in \{1,\ldots,m\}$),</li>
<li>The vertices with rooks must induce a connected subgraph of $G$ (hence the reference to a ""lifeline"" that must connect all rooks).</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of a chessboard with a single rook (indicated by the black vertex) is shown here</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VLUCx.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VLUCx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The gray squares show the area covered by the rook - no other rook can be placed on any of the gray squares. Note that I have neglected to color the squares themselves black and white as they should appear on a real chessboard. Edges are indicated by red lines.</p>

<p>Let's consider how we might extend the neighborhood of the black node - call it $v$. There are three vertices adjacent to $v$, but we can only place rooks on at most two of them at a time without violating the constraint that only a single rook cover a given row/column. In fact, there are two ways of placing the rooks, as shown here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YXJIp.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YXJIp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>and <a href=""http://img257.imageshack.us/img257/118/option2m.png"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> (broken link).</p>

<p>A <em>maximal</em> configuration is a valid placement of rooks (according to our constraints) that cannot be extended by the addition of another rook without violating the constraints.</p>

<p>We can enumerate all maximal configurations by performing a back-tracking depth-first search  from each node (i.e. each square on the chessboard). With a depth-first search, we only add one rook to the chessboard at a time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose that we perform a back-tracking breadth-first search instead. At each step, we add as many rooks the board as possible. Of course there possibly are many different ways of adding as many rooks as possible at each step. This is exactly what is done in the two images above: the maximum number of rooks are added in both possible configurations.</p>
  
  <p>Will this strategy also enumerate all maximal configurations?</p>

"<p>While studying some seemingly unrelated topological questions, I have experimentally discovered what appears (to me) to be a remarkable sum over partitions.  I was wondering if anyone knows how to prove it.</p>

<p>Fixing $n \geq 1$, it can be stated as follows:</p>

<p>$$1=\sum_{(a_1^{k_1},\ldots,a_p^{k_p}) \vdash n} \left(\frac{1}{(a_1^{k_1}) (k_1 !)}\right) \left(\frac{1}{(a_2^{k_2}) (k_2 !)}\right)\cdots\left(\frac{1}{(a_p^{k_p}) (k_p !)}\right).$$
Here the sum is over all unordered partitions of $n$, and the symbol $(a_1^{k_1},\ldots,a_p^{k_p})$ denotes the partition where $a_1$ appears $k_1 \geq 1$ times, where $a_2$ appears $k_2 \geq 1$ times, etc, and where $a_1 &gt; a_2 &gt; \cdots &gt; a_p &gt; 0$.</p>

Note that $D=G$ is a difference set with $\lambda=|G|$, and so we typically only consider nontrival difference sets.</p>

"<p>After seeing that some positivity problems get their solutions on MO,
I am quite enthusiastic of posing my (and not only) problem of positive flavour.</p>

<p>In order to state it, I have to introduce the standard $q$-notation:
$$ (x ; q)_n = \prod _ {j = 1} ^n (1-q^{j-1} x) $$
which is seen to be a polynomial in both $x$ and $q$ for any <em>finite</em> $n=0,1,2,\dots$
(the empty product for $n=0$ has to be interpreted as $1$) but is also
meaningful for $n=\infty$ if $|q|&lt;1$.</p>

<p>""My"" polynomials are
$$
P _n(q)
=\sum _{r=1}^n \frac{ q^{r^2} (q;q) _{3n-r} (q^3;q^3) _{r-1} }{ (q;q) _r (q;q) _{2r-1} (q^3;q^3) _{n-r} }.
$$
To convince you that they are indeed polynomials I write them as
$$
P _n(q)
=\sum _{r=1}^n(1+q^r)q^{r^2}\left[\begin{matrix} 3n-r \cr 2r\end{matrix}\right] _q
\frac{(q^3;q^3) _{r-1}}{(q;q) _{r-1}}(q;q^3) _{n-r}(q^2;q^3) _{n-r}
$$
where
$$
\left[\begin{matrix} a \cr b\end{matrix}\right] _q
=\frac{(q;q) _a}{(q;q) _b(q;q) _{a-b}}
$$
are the $q$-binomial coefficients, or the Gaussian polynomials.</p>

<p>What I can show for the polynomials $P _n(q)$ is that their degree is $3n^2-1$,
they are reciprocal (that is, $P _n(q)=q^{3n^2}P _n(1/q)$) and involve only
powers of $q$ not divisible by 3.</p>

<p>What I cannot show is that the coefficients of these polynomials
are nonnegative. Note that, for $r=1,\dots,n$, the polynomials
$$
(1+q^r)q^{r^2}\left[\begin{matrix} 3n-r \cr 2r\end{matrix}\right] _q
\frac{(q^3;q^3) _{r-1}}{(q;q) _{r-1}}
$$
have nonnegative coefficients (as the Gaussian polynomials do) but the
additional multiple
$$
(q;q^3) _{n-r}(q^2;q^3) _{n-r}
=\prod _{j=1}^{n-r}(1-q^{3j-2})(1-q^{3j-1})
$$
changes the picture drastically.</p>

<p>An additional note in favour of the expected positivity is the limiting case
$n\to\infty$:
$$
P _\infty(q)
=\frac{(q;q) _\infty}{(q^3;q^3) _\infty}
\sum _{r=1}^\infty\frac{q^{r^2}(q^3;q^3) _{r-1}}{(q;q) _r(q;q) _{2r-1}}.
$$
This series is the sum of two Virasoro characters and is thus
a positive series. The latter can be also shown hypergeometrically
and/or using the theory of modular forms (as $P _\infty(q)$ is a modular form).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A $(p, q, r)$ Steiner system is a collection of $q$-element subsets $A$ (called blocks) of an $r$-element set $S$ such that every $p$-element subset of $S$ is contained in a unique element of $A$.  Good examples come from considering as blocks the set of hyperplanes in $\mathbb{A}^n$ or $\mathbb{P}^n$ over a finite field.  For example, $\mathbb{A}^2$ over $\mathbb{F}_3$ gives a $(2, 3, 9)$ Steiner system:  it contains $9$ ($\mathbb{F}_3$-rational) points, and let the blocks be the lines, each of which consists of $3$ points.  Then any $2$ points are contained in a unique line.  This is the unique $(2, 3, 9)$ Steiner system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, considering lines in $\mathbb{A}^n$ or $\mathbb{P}^n$ gives an analogous Steiner system, and papers such as <a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/62157221j2718857/"">this one</a> contain similar constructions.</p>

<p>Loosely, my question is:  which Steiner systems come from similar constructions?  I'll make this more precise in a bit.</p>

<p>An artificial construction allows us to realize any Steiner system as the points of a variety in $\mathbb{A}^n$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$, the blocks of which are given by the intersection of the variety with some specified hyperplanes, as follows.  (This construction is due to Jeremy Booher.)  Say we have a $(p,q, r)$ Steiner system with $k$ blocks; consider the subvariety of $\mathbb{A}^k$ containing the point $y_j=(a_i)_{1\leq i\leq k}$ with $a_i=0$ if the $j$-th element in our Steiner system is in block $i$ and $1$ otherwise.  Then the intersections with the hyperplanes $x_i=0$ give our blocks.  And this subset is a variety as any subset of $\mathbb{A}^k$ is a variety, as it is finite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So let us try for something harder:  Which Steiner systems $(p, q, r)$ come from a subvariety $X$ of $\mathbb{A}^n$ or $\mathbb{P}^n$ containing $r$ ($\mathbb{F}_s$-rational) points, with the blocks given as the intersections with <em>all</em> $p+1$-dimensional hyperplanes?  A slightly weaker version: when is there a subvariety $X$ of $\mathbb{A}^n$ or $\mathbb{P}^n$ with $r$ $\mathbb{F}_s$-rational points such that every $p+1$-plane intersects $X$ at $q$ points?  In particular, this requires that any $p$ points in $X$ be in general position, so things like rational normal curves are natural candidates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is probably too hard, so perhaps the simpler question is tractable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you prove that some Steiner system does not come from this construction?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT:  One way of doing this might be to find a Steiner system with $b$ blocks, where $b$ is not a $q$-binomial coefficient with $q$ a prime power; such systems exist for $p=1$ but I am looking for a non-trivial example.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:  For what groups does there exist a Hamiltonian path in $K(G)$ whose edge labels exhaust the elements of $G$, apart from the identity?</p>

<p>Some observations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If $G={\Bbb Z}/12{\Bbb Z}$, mathematical music theory calls such paths ""all-interval rows.""</p></li>
<li><p>No such paths exist for cyclic groups of odd order greater than 1 because the sum of all elements in such a group equals the identity.  More generally, when $G$ abelian has such a path, I believe that $G$ must have exactly one factor of even order when expressed as a product of cyclic groups, or equivalently, a unique element of order 2.  I don't know the status of the converse.  </p></li>
<li><p>Any Hamiltonian path determines a sequence of $|G|-1$ non-identity edge labels.  Heuristically, a random such sequence has probability  $(|G|-1)!/ {(|G|-1)}^{|G|-1}$ of having no repeated labels.  This predicts that the desired paths exist in great profusion, at least absent any global obstruction as in the previous comment.  Where I have made exhaustive searches either no desired paths turned up at all, or I saw a total reasonably consistent with the heuristic.  Can one prove or disprove anything along these lines?  Even-order cyclic groups have paths of the desired sort, but I don't have any interesting bounds on the total counts even in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>The case of dihedral times ${\Bbb Z}/2{\Bbb Z}$ has mathematical music theory interest.
Paths exist in profusion with the dihedral group factor having order 6, 8, 10, 12 or 24 (the musically most interest case!), but I've yet to see any desired paths searching orders 14, though this might simply reflect the vast size of the search space.

"<p>The question on games and mathematics that appeared recently on mathoverflow
(<a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/13638/which-popular-games-are-the-most-mathematical"">Which popular games are the most mathematical?</a>)
reminded me of a problem I encountered some time ago : starting with the insane
dream of completely solving the game of bridge with a nice mathematical theory,
I ended up considering extremely simplified versions of bridge. One of them was 
as follows : there are only 2 players instead of 4, and instead of the usual
deck there are only 2n cards numbered from 1 to 2n. Each player holds half 
of the deck, so this is a ""complete information"" game : each player knows exactly
what is in his opponent's hand. There are no bids, just a sequence of n moves
where each player drops a card ; as in bridge the strongest card wins the trick
and the winner of the game is the player with the largest number of tricks
in the end (take n odd to avoid draws). Also, the winner of the preceding
trick is the first to play (for the very first move the first player is determined
by some rule, random or other ; this is immaterial to the subsequent discussion).</p>

<p>This looks like a very basic kind of game, especially amenable to 
mathematization : for example the set of all initial positions is nicely indexed
by the subsets $I$ of $\lbrace 1,2, \ldots , 2n\rbrace$ whose cardinality is $n$
(say $I$ is the set of cards held by the first player). I was
however unable to answer the following questions :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is there an algorithm which, given the initial position, finds out which player
will win if each one plays optimally ? What is the best strategy ?</p>

<ul>
<li>Has this game already been studied by combinatorialists ?</li>

"<p>How I arrived at this question is a rather long story having to do with the honors calculus class I am teaching. At this point it's sheer curiosity on my part. Here is the game.</p>

<p>$\newcommand{\bZ}{\mathbb{Z}}$</p>

<p>We start with a finite collection of stones placed  at random  somewhere on the set of nodes $\newcommand{\eN}{\mathscr{N}}$ $$\eN=\{2,3,4,\dotsc\}. $$      We can view a distribution  of stones as a  function $s:\eN\to\bZ_{\geq 0} $ with finite support, $s(n)=$ the number of stones at $n$. Its <em>weight</em>  is the nonnegative integer</p>

<p>$$|s|=\sum_{n\in\eN} s(n). $$</p>

<p>We say that a distribution $s$ is <em>overcrowded</em>  if $s(n)&gt; 1$ for some $n\in\eN$. A node $n$ is called  <em>occupied</em> (with respect to $s$) if there is at least one stone at $n$, $s(n)&gt;0$. </p>

<p>We are allowed the following moves:  choose an occupied node $n$. Then   you move one stone from location $n$ to location $n+1$ and add a new stone at location $n^2$.    Note that such a move increases the weight by $1$.</p>

<p>Now comes the question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it true that for any  initial distribution of stones $s:\eN\to\bZ_{\geq 0}$ and any positive integer $N$   there exists a finite sequence of  allowable moves   such that after these moves we obtain a  new distribution of stones  which (i) is <strong>not</strong> overcrowded, and (ii) no node $n&lt;N$ is occupied.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Empirical evidence leads  me to believe that the answer to this question is positive. However, I have failed to find a conclusive argument.I'm hoping  someone  in the MO community will have more luck.</p>

<p><strong>Remark 1.</strong> (<em>Inspired by David Eppstein's answer.</em>) I want to show that if the function $n\mapsto n^2$ in the definition of an allowable move is replaced by something else the answer to the question can be  negative.   In other words, any proof for  the positive answer, would have to take into account some features of the map $n\mapsto n^2$.</p>

<p>Here is the example. Fix an integer $k&gt;1$ and  define $f:\eN\to\eN$, $f(n)=n+k$.   Now change the definition of an allowable move as  follows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pick an occupied node $m$. Move a stone from location $m$ to $m+1$ and
  add a stone  at the node $f(m)$.  We will  denote by $T_m$ this move.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let $s_0:\eN\to\bZ_{\geq 0}$ be the configuration consisting of a single stone located at $n=2$. <em>I claim that there exists  $N&gt;0$ such that $s_0$ cannot be moved past $N$ without overcrowding.</em>   </p>

<p>The proof is based on a conservation law suggested by David Eppstein's answer.  Consider the polynomial $P(x)=x^k+x-1$. Note that $P(0)&lt;0$ and $P(1)&gt;0$ so  $P$ has at least one root  in the interval $(0,1)$. Pick one such root $\rho$.  We use $\rho$ to define the <em>energy</em> of a configuration $s:\eN\to\bZ_{\geq 0}$ to be</p>

<p>$$ E(s):=\sum_{n\in \eN} s(n)\rho^n. $$</p>

<p>If $m$ is an occupied location of a configuration $s:\eN\to\bZ_{\geq 0}$, then</p>

<p>$$E(T_m s)= E(s)-\rho^m+\rho^{m+1}+\rho^{m+k}=E(s)+\rho^mP(\rho)=E(s). $$</p>

<p>Thus allowable moves do not change the energy of a configuration.</p>

<p>Let $N$ be a positive integer such that</p>

<p>$$\rho^{N-2}&lt;1-\rho. \tag{1} $$</p>

<p>Suppose now that using allowable move we can transform  $s_0$ to a configuration $s$ such that</p>

<p>$$ s(n)=0,\;\;\forall n&lt;N,\;\;s(n)\in \{0,1\},\;\;\forall n\geq N. $$</p>

<p>Then</p>

<p>$$\rho^2= E(s_0)=E(s)\leq \sum_{n\geq N}\rho^n=\frac{\rho^N}{1-\rho}. $$</p>

<p>This last inequality violates the assumption (1), thus confirming my claim.</p>

<p><strong>Remark 2.</strong> The example in the previous remark has the following  obvious  generalization. Suppose that $f:\eN\to\eN$ is a function  such that $f(n)&gt;n+1$, $\forall n \in \eN$ and there exists a probability measure $\pi$ on $\eN$ such that</p>

<p>$$ \pi\bigl(\; f(n)\;\bigr)+\pi(n+1)-\pi(n)\geq 0,\;\;\forall n\in\eN. \tag{2}$$</p>

<p>Using  $f$ to define the allowable  moves, one can show that  there exists $N&gt;0$ such that $s_0$ cannot be moved past $N$ without overcrowding.   The proof uses the <em>entropy</em></p>

<p>$$E_\pi(s)=\sum_{n\in\eN}s(n)\pi(n). $$</p>

<p>Note that this entropy  is precisely the expectation of $s$ with respect to the probability measure $\pi$, and it <em>does not decrease</em> as we apply allowable moves</p>

<p>$$E(s)\leq E(T_m s), \;\;\forall s. $$</p>

<p>For $f(n)=n+k$ we can define</p>

<p>$$ \pi(n)=(1-\rho)\rho^{n-2}. $$</p>

<p>This remark raises the following natural  question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Find the functions $f:\eN\to \eN$ such that $f(n)&gt;n+1$, $\forall n\in \eN$,
  and there exists a probability measure $\pi$ on $\eN$ satisfying
  (2). How fast can such a function grow as $n\to \infty$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Remark 3.</strong> (a) For $f(n)=n^2$ the condition (2) reads</p>

<p>$$ \pi(n^2)+\pi(n+1)\geq \pi(n). \tag{3} $$</p>

<p>One can show that a  series   $$\sum_{n\geq 1}p(n) $$ with  nonnegative terms satisfying (3) is  divergent if not all the terms are trivial. (This was the rather tricky honors calculus problem that prompted the present question.)  Hence,  for the function $f(n)=n^2$, there do not exist  probability measures  satisfying (2), suggesting indirectly that the original question could have  a positive answer.</p>

<p>(b) If $f(n)=n +1+ \lfloor \sqrt{n}\rfloor$,   $\alpha&gt;1$ is sufficiently close to $1$ and </p>

<p>$$\pi(n)=\frac{C}{n^\alpha}, \;\;C\sum_{n\geq 2}\frac{1}{n^\alpha}=1,$$</p>

<p>then the condition (2) is satisfied so  moving without overcrowding is not possible if the allowable moves use the function $f(n)$.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to find the exact asymptotics of a sum:</p>

<p>$$A = \sum^n_{i=0} \begin{pmatrix} 2n \\ i \end{pmatrix} x^{i} y^{2n-i} $$</p>

<p>as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Here $x,y$ are complex numbers, $|x|\leq1, |y|\leq1$. I also have $|x+y|&lt;1$ and $|4xy|\leq1$. My strategy is to write the sum as an integral.
Rewrite this sum as:
$$ A = (x+y)^{2n} - 
\sum^{n-1}_{i=0} \begin{pmatrix} 2n \\ i \end{pmatrix} x^{2n-i} y^i \quad\quad\quad\quad (1) $$</p>

<p>Note that this is a remainder for the $(n-1)$-order Taylor expansion so can use the integral formula for the remainder:</p>

<p>$$ A = \begin{pmatrix} 2n \\ n \end{pmatrix} y^n \int^1_0 (x+(1-t)y)^n nt^{n-1} dt $$</p>

<p>Changing variables and introducing $z=x/y$ get:</p>

<p>$$  A =  \begin{pmatrix} 2n \\ n \end{pmatrix} (xy)^n \int^1_0 (1+(1-u^{\frac{1}{n}})z)^n du  $$</p>

<p>In this integral the integrand converges to $u^{-z}$. Then for $Re(z)&lt;1$ the integral converges and I get (using Stirling's formula) the following asymptotic expression:</p>

<p>$$ A \sim \frac{(4xy)^n}{\sqrt{n}}\frac{1}{1-z} $$</p>

<p>On the other hand, I can approximate the <strong>second</strong> term in $(1)$ as the Taylor remainder thus interchanging the roles of $x,y$ and then get for $Re(1/z)&lt;1$ that </p>

<p>$$ A \sim (x+y)^{2n} - \frac{(4xy)^n}{\sqrt{n}}\frac{1}{1-1/z} $$</p>

<p>However, now I have something very strange: when both $Re(z)&lt;1$ and $Re(1/z)&lt;1$ are valid, both asymptotic expressions have to agree, which means that it must be $|x+y|^2 &lt; |4xy|$. But it's clearly not true - take for example $x=-1/2$ and $y=1/100$ which satisfy the conditions on $Re(z)$ and $Re(1/z)$. Where have I made a mistake?</p>

<p>0) Let $V$ be the standard (2-dimensional) representation of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ (over complex numbers, say). </p>

<p>1) Dimension of the algebra $\operatorname{End}_{\mathfrak{sl}_2}(V^{\otimes n})$ is $C_n$, the $n$-th Catalan number.</p>

<p>3) It follows easily from the formula $V\otimes S^k(V)\cong S^{k-1}(V)\oplus S^{k+1}(V)$ used in the above answer that the numbers $m_{n,k}$ form the <a href=""https://oeis.org/A053121"" rel=""nofollow"">Catalan triangle</a></p>

"<p>I recently proved an inequality relating some of the eigenvalues of a regular graph with each other, and I was wondering if it is already known. I was unable to find it online, and a quick skim through Spectra Of Graphs by Brouwer and Haemers did not locate it. The inequality is as follows:</p>

<p>Let $G$ be a connected $k$-regular graph on $n$ vertices which is not complete. Let $\theta$ be the second largest eigenvalue of (the adjacency matrix of) $G$, and let $\tau$ be its minimum eigenvalue. Then,
$$\theta \ge \frac{k(n+\tau-k)}{\tau - n\tau - k}$$
with equality if and only if $G$ is strongly regular.</p>

<p>I came upon the inequality in a very roundabout way, but then found a quite simple proof, so I thought it may already be known. It is probably not a very useful inequality since it only relates eigenvalues to each other and not to any other parameters of the graph. Perhaps this is why it is hard to find online if it is indeed already known.</p>

"<p>I would like to know whether the problem described below has appeared in the literature and/or whether similar questions have been studied. I would be very happy to find some references or, if none exist, other people that might enjoy thinking about these questions.</p>

<p>Fix a finite abelian group $G$. The <em>Davenport constant</em> $D(G)$ is the smallest integer $m$ such that for any sequence $g_1, \ldots, g_m$ of elements of $G$ (repetitions allowed), there is some non-empty subsequence with sum zero, that is $\exists  J \subseteq [m]$ with $J \neq \emptyset$ and $\sum_{j \in J} g_j = 0$.</p>

<p>There is a very neat folklore proof showing that $D(G) \leq |G|$: given any sequence of $|G|$ elements, let $s_k$ denote the sum of the first $k$ entries of the sequence. If one of the $s_k$ is zero, we are done. Otherwise by the pigeon-hole principle, two of them are equal, say $s_i = s_j$ for $i &lt; j$. But then $J = (i+1, \ldots, j)$ does it.</p>

<p>For cyclic groups, this bound is easily seen to be tight. In the general case, the situation is much more difficult and the determination of $D(G)$ is still an open problem. What I want to get at is the following: The proof above shows more than just the existence of <em>any</em> subsequence with sum zero, it tells us that we can find one among a much smaller collection of candidates, namely all the subsequences of consecutive elements! Quantitatively, this narrows the exponential-size collection of all subsequences down to one of quadratic size (wrt $|G|$ in both cases).</p>

<p>Taking a small step of abstraction, let's call a hyper-graph (a collection of non-empty subsets of some finite set $V$) $G$-zero if for every labelling $f$ of its vertices with the elements of $G$ (repetitions allowed), there is some hyper-edge $e$ such that $\sum_{v \in e} f(v) = 0$. By definition, the hyper graph of all non-empty subsets of $V$ is $G$-zero if and only if $|V| \geq D(G)$. By the proof above, the hyper graph of all subpaths of a path on $n$ vertices is $G$-zero for $n \geq |G|$ (it is not hard to show that this is also necessary). The Erdos-Ginzburg-Ziv Theorem asserts that the hyper graph of all $n$-element subsets is $\mathbb{Z} / n\mathbb{Z}$-zero if $|V| \geq 2n-1$.</p>

<p>The question I am asking is: Given $G$ and $n \geq D(G)$, what is the minimum number $m_G(n)$ of edges in a $G$-zero hyper graph with $n$ vertices? How does this quantity behave as a function of $n$? What are the extremal hyper graphs?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Maybe I should add some more detail. </p>

<p>(1) <em>What to aim for</em>: Since determining $D(G)$ is in general very hard, a complete solution might be out of reach (although it is conceivable that minimising this parameter is much easier). But solving it for some restricted classes of groups might be possible; for example for cyclic groups of prime order there is quite a lot of algebraic machinery that might help.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Some easy observations</em>: The argument presented above shows that there is a $G$-zero hyper graph on $\binom{|G|+1}{2}$ edges. For a lower bound on $m_G(n)$, let $H$ be a $G$-zero hyper graph on $n$ vertices. Just as with vertex-colorings of graphs, it is easy to show that $H$ must have a sub-hypergraph with minimum-degree at least $|G|$. Unfortunately, the edges might be very large and so double-counting only gives us
$$
|E(H)| \geq |G| + \frac{1}{n-1}(|G|-1).
$$
Hence roughly speaking, $m_G(n)$ always lies somewhere between $|G|$ and $|G|^2$. In the case of $G = (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^m$, the complete hyper graph on $D(G) = m+1$ vertices is a surprisingly good candidate with only $2|G| - 1$ edges, almost matching the lower bound. For cyclic groups, on the other hand, this hyper graph is quite terrible.</p>

"<p>Apologies for the length question. Those acquainted with the analytics industry will know that the next big thing in the information technology world will be the Big Data revolution where huge volumes of data will be processed. Big Data revolution will imply huge requirement of storage space/memory hence it is critical to store data as efficiently as possible. We want to store data in the smartest way that requires the least amount of storage. The following question is on the application of mathematical ideas to reduce the amount of storage memory required to store information of a particular kind.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: This is a consumer information storage problem. There are $k$ customers and $n$ books. Each customer can buy one or more books (<strong>without repetition</strong>). We want to identify the book purchased by a given customer using the minimum number of memory required for storage. <em>We do not seek to improve the time complexity, we only seek to reduce storage space required</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Method 1 - Traditional approach</strong>: This is the common and default approach. Give each book a $d$ digit code and create a field in the data base where the code of the books purchased by the customer in entered, separated by commas. So in the worst case when a customer has brought all $n$ books, we will need $D = nd+d-1$ characters to store this information (including $d-1$ commas) about the customer. </p>

<p><strong>Method 2. Using prime numbers</strong>: Assign a unique prime number to each of the books, 2 denotes the first book, 3 the second, $\ldots$ and $p_n$ denotes the $n$-th. Every customer $C_i$ assigned a number $N_i$ which is equal to the product of the prime numbers corresponding to books purchased. By factoring $N_i$, unique factorization theorem ensures that we can identify the exactly the books purchased by the customer. More over two customers will have a common book if and only if they have a common factor. The greater the number of common factors, the greater is the similarity between the customers. This this method in principle carries more business information. Let us do the heuristics for the number of characters needed. In the worst case when the customer $C_i$ has purchased all the $n$ books,
$$
N_i = p_1 p_2 \ldots p_n &lt; p_n^n.
$$
(<em>This inequality can be strengthened using the estimates of the Chevyshev function of the first kind but right now, that is not the objective as I only want to demonstrate the underlying idea</em>). Hence the number of characters required is
$$
D_i = \log_{10} N_i &lt; n\log_{10}p_n &lt; nd + d - 1
$$</p>

<p>for $p_n &lt; 10^d$ which is a safe assumption since most of the UPC code numbers given to products sold in the market have multiple digits. Hence with a small number of books say $&lt;100$ we expect method 2 to use lesser number of character (hence memory) to store the same information. For example if I have 10 books them to store the information about a customer who purchased all the 10 books, method one with a 2 digit code for each book will require 21 characters where as method 2 will require only 10 characters. Unfortunately when there are a large number of books, the products of primes grows very fast and we may end up requiring more memory space than in method 1. Hence this method is not scale-able.</p>

<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: We can do better than method 2. Let the $k$-th book be given the number $2^{k}$. Every time a customer buys a unique book, we add its corresponding number. Since a number can be decomposed as the sum of non-repeating powers of two in only one way, we can identify the exact books purchased by the customer $C_i$ by decomposing his/her total sum $S_i$. For example if the sum of the book numbers for a customer is 154, since $154=2^7 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1$, we know that the customer has purchased the first, third, fourth and the seventh book. So instead of storing the code of these four books or the product of three primes, I can just store the three digit number 154 which will give me the same information. In the worst case when the customer has purchased all the n books,</p>

<p>$$
S_i = 2^1 + 2^2 +\ldots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2
$$</p>

<p>$$
D_i &lt; \log_{10}(2^{n+1}-2) &lt; n\log_{10}2 + 1
$$</p>

<p>Thus with method 3, we can store the same information using the least number of characters thus far. Also two customers will have a book in common if and only if the decomposition of their sum contains an identical power of 2.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>: Is there are better method of identifying the books uniquely using less than $n\log_{10}2$ characters? I think that if there is indeed a better method, it could possible be using some of the property of integers.</p>

<p>Lower Bound: 1 or 2. If $|E|$ is divisible by $n$, then $\frac{|E|}{n}$ nodes can be connected to completely to $\frac{|E|}{n}$ other nodes, making one maximal biclique.

<p>Upper Bound: There are $2^n$ unique subsets, the empty set and the entire set not included, leaves $2^n-2$ subsets. Therefore, there can be at most $2^n-2$ maximal bicliques. This upper bound is achievable when there are $n^2-n$ edges (I can prove this if anyone wants me to).</p>

<p>A complex is shifted if for any $A \in \Delta$, if we replace $i \in A$ with some $j \notin A$, such that $j &lt; i$, then the set is still in the complex.</p>

<p>A complex is a threshold complex if there are some non-negative weights $w_1,\ldots,w_n,c$ such that $A \in \Delta \iff \sum_{i\in A} b_i \leq c$. Note that if the weights are in increasing order, this will be a shifted complex.</p>

<p>A facet of a complex is a member $A \in \Delta$ such that no supersets of $A$ are in $\Delta$.</p>

<p>Also given $B$ we define $\bar{B}$ as the family of subsets of $B$(including B).</p>

<p>A shelling of a complex $\Delta$ is an ordering $F_1,F_2,\ldots$ of the facets of $\Delta$, such that $\left(\cup_{i=1}^{k-1} \bar{F_i}\right) \cap \bar{F_k}$ is a complex in which all facets have size $|F_k|-1$.</p>

<p>It is known that shifted complexes(and in particular threshold complexes) have shellings, one of which is given by the reverse lexicographical ordering of the facets. Let's say that a particular shelling gives the decomposition
$ \Delta = \cup_{i=0}^t \bar{F_i}$, and I define the partial shelling $\Delta_k = \cup_{i=0}^k \bar{F_i}$ for $k=1,\ldots, t$. Can we find a shelling that makes $\Delta_k$ shifted(threshold)?</p>

"<p>Let $n$ be a positive integer and partition a grid of $4n$ by $4n$ unit squares into $4n^2$ squares of sidelength $2$. (The squares with sidelength $2$ have all of their sides on the gridlines of the $4n$ by $4n$ grid.) What's the minimum number of unit squares that can be shaded such that every square of sidelength $2$ has at least one shaded square, and there exists a path between any two shaded squares going from shaded squares to adjacent shaded squares? (Two squares are adjacent of they share a side.)</p>

<p>I think the answer is $6n^2-2$. I got it by partitioning the $4n$ by $4n$ unit squares into $n^2$ squares of sidelength $4$, shading in the four center unit squares of each sidelength $4$ square (so that every square with sidelength $2$ has at least one shaded square), and connecting the shaded squares to another. There are $4n^2$ center unit squares, and a connection between any two groups of center squares requires two squares. There are $n^2$ groups of center squares, so for the shaded squares to be connected, we need at least $n^2-1$ connections. (Similar to how a connected graph on $n$ vertices needs at least $n-1$ edges.) Each connection is two squares, so we need to shade an additional $2(n^2-1)$ squares. Adding this to $4n^2$ gives $6n^2-2$.</p>

<p>This is by no means a proof. There are of course valid configurations in which some square with sidelength $4$ does not have the center $4$ squares shaded in. Could someone help me prove that $6n^2-2$ is the minimum? Thanks.</p>

    I'd like to find the expected number of Bernoulli trials that I'll need before I will get <em>exactly</em> n more heads than tails, given a coin which gets a heads with probability p. </p>

<p>My approach for this problem has been as follows:
a) The probability of getting n more heads is equal to getting any permutation of N+r-1 heads and r tails, followed by a single head, thus  $\sum_{r=0}^{\infty} p^{n+r}(1-p)^{r}$ ${n+2r-1}\choose{r}$</p>

<p>c) I need to find the expectation over the trial lengths of $\gamma^{l}$ ($\gamma$ is a constant $&lt;1$), i.e. $\sum_{r=0}^{\infty} \gamma^{n+2r} p^{n+r}(1-p)^{r}$ ${n+2r-1}\choose{r}$</p>

<p>Let P be a locally finite* graded poset with a minimal element, and w be a weight function on the elements of P. Suppose that the total weight of the elements of rank k is bounded by 1. Then is the total weight of any antichain bounded by 1, or some constant c (independent of P or w?) The answer, of course, is no, and it's not hard to construct a counterexample. So what are the minimal conditions on P and/or w needed for such a result?</p>

<p>Note that this should specialize to several well-known theorems. Taking the poset to be a Boolean lattice and w to be 1/(n \choose k), we obtain the LYM inequality, hence the question title. Taking the poset to be the set of finite-length binary words with X \leq Y if X is a prefix of Y, and w to be 1/2^k, we get back Kraft's inequality. And finally, for arbitrary P and setting w to be the constant function 1, we get back (half of a special case of) Dilworth's theorem.</p>

<p>A secondary question: assuming such a result exists, is there a probabilistic proof of it, similar to the probabilistic proofs of Kraft and LYM?</p>

<p>Edit 4: Most of the counterexamples I've constructed thus far have had trees as the underlying poset (i.e., if X \leq Z and Y \leq Z, then either X \leq Y or Y \leq X). This subcase seems to simplify the analysis somewhat, so it might be worth considering only trees.</p>

<p>In fact, here's a toy problem which itself seems rather difficult: Can we characterize the weight functions on the infinite rooted binary tree, with the weight of each graded part equal to 1, that satisfy the strong property that the weight of any antichain is at most 1? </p>

<p>*Edit: Actually we want something somewhat stronger than local finiteness, namely that every element is covered by finitely many elements, so that there are are only finitely many elements of any given rank.</p>

<p>Edit^2: Of course we also want the weight function to be nonnegative, or else scary bad things can start happening. </p>

<p>The obvious restriction on the weight function requires it to be dependent only on the rank; interestingly, this is neither necessary nor sufficient for the strong form of the conjecture (i.e. the maximal weight of any antichain \leq the maximal weight of all the elements of rank k) to hold. (Counterexamples available upon request.) I'm still searching for a counterexample in this situation to the weak form of the conjecture (Edit^3: Counterexample found.), where every rank has bounded total weight but there are arbitrarily heavy antichains.</p>

<p>In our example, $X=\{w,b \}$, $p_n$ would count all necklaces with white and black points having in total $n$ points (not up to rotation).

Now I want to do all this in a weighted situation, so for example I want to take how many points are black into considerations. Thus, I need multivariable generating function. In the example $X= \{w, b \}$, this would be $u(x,y)=x+y$.

<p>Consider a $2$-coloring of the edges of a complete graph on $N=2^{k+l}$ vertices, $v_1, ..., v_N$.

<p>(This is a sketch; it's worth working out the details.)  Represent a two-coloring of the edges of a complete graph on $n$ vertices as the upper triangle (strictly above the diagonal) of an $n\times n$ matrix of zeroes and ones (that is, ${n\choose 2}$ bits).  We may rewrite this representation by noting which vertices are contained in our monochrome subgraph and what color it is, as well as including all the remaining edge data, using some special characters to block off this data.  If Ramsey numbers are small, this sends each string of bits under an appropriate encoding to a smaller string of bits, which is impossible by pigeonhole.  (I am being purposely vague about the encoding--pick your own, anything goes essentially--because it's a bit boring).  The bound this argument gives is essentially the same as the probabilistic one, and indeed it seems to me to be essentially a ""derandomization"" of that argument.</p>

The hyperedges are placed independently uniformly at random.  I would like to have a handle on the behavior of the sizes of the connected components.  By ""size"" I refer to the number of edges in the component, but understanding the number of vertices would be fine too.</p>

<p>For instance, if $X$ is the size of the component containing the first hyperedge, it seems like we should have $\Pr[X &gt; t] &lt; 1/2^t$.  This is because each hyperedge has a less than $1/4$ chance of intersecting any other hyperedge, so this seems like some sort of exponentially decaying branching process.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it seems like there should be a negative association among component sizes: the larger one component is, the smaller the other ones are.  Suppose I give each component in the graph a unique random label in $[k]$, and let $Y_i$ be the size of the component labeled $i$ (or 0 if no component has label $i$).  Then I expect that $E[Y_i | Y_j = t]$ for $j \neq i$ is decreasing in $t$.  Moreover, I expect that the random variable $(Y_i | Y_j = t)$ is decreasing in $t$: the variable with small $t$ dominates the variable with large $t$.</p>

<p>Let &#954;(G) denote the number of spanning trees of G (the <em>complexity</em> of G), and let L(G) denote the Laplacian matrix of G. Finally, for a vertex v of G, let L(v|v) denote the Laplacian matrix with the row and column corresponding to v deleted.</p>

Because my students might not remember things like Cauchy-Binet, but mainly so that I myself feel that I can really understand what I'm teaching, I wonder how the Matrix-Tree Theorem could be proven without ever mentioning matrices. On a planet with strong combinatorics and where linear algebra had not been discovered, how would they prove the Matrix-Tree Theorem?</p>

<p>The RHS of the Matrix-Tree Theorem makes sense without ever mentioning matrices, via the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindstr%C3%B6m%E2%80%93Gessel%E2%80%93Viennot_lemma"">Lindstr&ouml;m-Gessel-Viennot</a>(-Karlin-MacGregor) Lemma. Construct a graph H,  with a source and a sink corresponding to each vertex of G, so that the signed sum of edge weights gives the entries of the Lagrangian matrix for G (surely there's a clever standard way to do this!) and define the determinant of H to be the signed sum of all n-tuples of non-intersecting paths from the sources to the sinks. This interpretation of the determinant seems a nice topic to teach. Maybe there's even an easier way.</p>

<p>Cauchy-Binet becomes an elementary property of sets of non-intersecting paths in H, but I can't see how to free the rest of the proof of the Matrix-Tree Theorem from linear algebra.</p>

<p><b>Note 1</b>: If the purpose of the Matrix-Tree Theorem is to efficiently calculate the complexity of a graph, then dodging linear algebra is surely counterproductive, because a determinant can efficiently be calculated in polynomial time.

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There is a counterexample in the non-cancellative case. For any $n$, let $E_n = \langle e \mid e^{n+2} = e^{n+1}\rangle$. For any group $G$, let $S$ be the quotient of $(G \times E_n)\cup\{0\}$ where we identify $(g,e^{n+1})$ with $0$ for every $g\in G$. Let $A$ be the image of $G\times \{e\}$ in $S$. Then $|A| = |AA| = \cdots = |A^n| = |G|$, but $|A|^{n+k} = 1$ for every $k \ge 1$. Taking a product of many examples like this and a free semigroup, we can arrange that $|A| = |AA| = \cdots = |A^n|$, but $|A^{n+k}| = |A|^{(n+k)/n}$ for every $k \ge 1$.</p>

<p>Here's an easy result which actually uses cancellativity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Thm:</strong> If $A$ is a subset of a cancellative semigroup $S$, then there is a subset $P \subseteq AA$ with $|P| \ge \frac{|A|}{2}$ such that for any subsets $C,B$ of $S$, we have $|CPB| \le 2\frac{|CA|}{|A|}\frac{|AB|}{|A|}|AA|$. In particular, $|AP^nA| \le 2^n\frac{|AA|^{2n}}{|A|^{2n}}|AA|$.</p>

"<p>Pretty much exactly what it says on the tin. Let G be a connected graph; then the Tutte polynomial T_G(x,y) carries a lot of information about G. However, it obviously doesn't encode everything about the graph, since there are examples of non-isomorphic graphs with the same Tutte polynomial.</p>

<p>My question is, what information exactly does the Tutte polynomial encapsulate? I'm aware of a few answers to this question, but I don't find any of them particularly satisfying. For instance, T_G(x,y) can be characterized as ""the universal Tutte-Grothendieck invariant,"" but the definition of Tutte-Grothendieck invariants is just as unintuitive as the definition of the Tutte polynomial (because it's essentially the same definition!) One can also define the coefficients as counting certain spanning trees of G, but this doesn't make apparent the fact that the Tutte polynomial specializes to the chromatic polynomial, or the notion that it carries most of the information one can obtain via linear algebra methods.</p>

<p>So is there a nice way of thinking about what data about G the Tutte polynomial encodes?</p>

<p>ETA: Okay, here's a very rough conjecture. Suppose that there's some ""computationally simple"" (i.e., testing membership is in NP) class of graphs such that there are two connected graphs G, H with the same Tutte polynomial, and G is in the class and H is not. Then there are spanning trees S, T of G, H respectively, such that S is in the class and T is not.</p>

<p>This would mean, in a sense that I can't make entirely rigorous, that the information about a graph G not encoded in the Tutte polynomial is just information about the structure of spanning trees of G. (Update: As Kevin Costello points out in a comment, this idea appears to be severely limited by the existence of certain pairs of co-Tutte graphs. In particular, we would need to count spanning trees with multiplicity for it to have even a chance of being true.)</p>

<p>As stated, the above conjecture is false for trivial reasons. But is there a way of making it true, perhaps by requiring the property to be, in some sense, natural? Is there a broad notion of ""graph properties"" for which it is true? Can we at least state a conjecture along these lines which does seem to be true?</p>

"<p>I have posted this question before but i don't feel i expressed my confusion clearly enough. So i would like to try and explain again. This is a proof of the minimum vertex cover for unit disk graphs being NP-complete.</p>

<p>The following lemma 2.1 is used </p>

<p>Lemma 2.1 (Valiant [19]). A planar graph $G$ with maximum degree 4 can be embedded in the plane using $O(|V|)$ area in such a way that its vertices are at integer coordinates and its edges are drawn so that they are made up of line segments of the form $x=i$ or $y=j$,for integers $i$ and $j$.</p>

<p>So in particular i'm now reading the section on UD vertex cover being NP hard (page 172)</p>

<p>THEOREM: UD Vertex cover is NP-Complete</p>

<p>Proof. The reduction is from PLANAR VERTEX COVER with maximum degree 3, which was shown NP-complete in [4]. As before, we transform the planar graph $G$ with maximum degree 3 to a unit disk graph $G’$ such that $G$ has a vertex cover $S$ with $|S|\leq k$ if and only if $G’$ has a vertex cover $S’$ with $|S'|\leq k’$.</p>

<p>We draw $G$ in the plane using Lemma 2.1. We then replace each edge $\{u, v\}$ by a path having an even number $2k_{uv}$,, of intermediate vertices, in such a way that an intersection model can be constructed. (This is clearly easy to do. Note, however, that a grid graph embedding will not be possible unless G is bipartite, which is why this construction does not work for grid graphs.)
It is straightforward to verify that $G$ has a vertex cover $S$ such that $|S| &lt;k$ if and only if $G’$ has a vertex cover $S’$ such that $|S'|\leq k+\sum_{uv \in E(G)} K_{uv}$.</p>

<p>So here is my confusion, they say the construction doesn't work for grid graphs, grid graphs here are unit disk graphs placed at integer co-ordinates on a grid with radius $1/2$. Firstly i want to make clear that i understand that the vertex cover problem on a grid graph is solvable in polynomial time as it is a bipartite graph. My question is if i placed a vertex at every integer point on the line between vertices $u$ and $v$ (similar to how they place $2k_{uv}$ disks on these lines) i would obtain a grid graph, so why is the problem so fundamentally different? Why does the condition that  $G$ has a vertex cover $S$ such that $|S| &lt;k$ if and only if $G’$ has a vertex cover $S’$ such that $|S'|\leq k+\sum_{uv \in E(G)} K_{uv}$ work for their construction but not for the construction i mentioned i.e where every edge is subdivided by integer co-ordinates to form a grid.</p>

It is also well-known that one can get a formula for the number of surjections using inclusion-exclusion, applied to the sets $X_1,...,X_m$, where for each $i$ the set $X_i$ is defined to be the set of functions that never take the value $i$. This gives rise to the following expression: $m^n-\binom m1(m-1)^n+\binom m2(m-2)^n-\binom m3(m-3)^n+\dots$.</p>

<p>Let us call this number $S(n,m)$. I'm wondering if anyone can tell me about the asymptotics of $S(n,m)$. A particular question I have is this: for (approximately) what value of $m$ is $S(n,m)$ maximized? It is a little exercise to check that there are more surjections to a set of size $n-1$ than there are to a set of size $n$. (To do it, one calculates $S(n,n-1)$ by exploiting the fact that every surjection must hit exactly one number twice and all the others once.) So the maximum is not attained at $m=1$ or $m=n$. </p>

<p>I'm assuming this is known, but a search on the web just seems to lead me to the exact formula. A reference would be great. A proof, or proof sketch, would be even better.</p>

<p><strong>Update.</strong> I should have said that my real reason for being interested in the value of m for which S(n,m) is maximized (to use the notation of this post) or m!S(n,m) is maximized (to use the more conventional notation where S(n,m) stands for a Stirling number of the second kind) is that what I care about is the rough size of the sum. The sum is big enough that I think I'm probably not too concerned about a factor of n, so I was prepared to estimate the sum as lying between the maximum and n times the maximum.</p>

<p>Now for some motivation.  In <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/29281/which-steiner-systems-come-from-algebraic-geometry"">this question</a> I ask for an algebra-geometric construction of certain Steiner systems (there's background on what Steiner systems are and on the details and motivation for the construction in that question).  In particular, if the construction can be carried out for a $(p, q, r)$ Steiner system, the blocks of the Steiner system would be given by the $p-1$-plane sections of some variety $X$ in affine or projective space over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$.  If $X$ is in affine $n+1$-space and $p=2$, the number of blocks would be given by $1+q+\cdots+q^n$.  Now the number of blocks in a $(2, 3, 6k+1)$ system is $k(6k+1)$ and the number of blocks in a $(2, 3, 6k+3)$ system is $(3k+1)(2k+1)$ (a $(2, 3, n)$ Steiner system is realizable iff $n=1, 3$ mod $6$, $n &gt; 3$).  So the question comes from setting these two quantities equal.</p>

<p>In other words, these equations must be solvable for all $k$ if the algebra-geometric construction of Steiner systems is to go through for all $(2, 3, n)$ systems (the Steiner triple systems) in affine space.</p>

<p>The most general form of this question (which covers both the affine and the projective versions) is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For integers $n, 1 &lt; p &lt; q &lt; r$, when is there a prime power $q$ such that $$\frac{r!(q-p)!}{q!(r-p)!}=\left[n \atop p-1\right]_q$$ or $$\frac{r!(q-p)!}{q!(r-p)!}=\left[n \atop p\right]_q?$$</p>

"<p>We are given $n$ coins, some of which are ""real"" and weigh $1$ and some of which are ""fake"" and weigh $0$.  We have one ""spring scale"" which can weigh any subset of the coins. A classic question asks what the minimum number of weighings is that will separate the real coins from the fake ones.  This question is essentially identical to <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/157634/number-of-vectors-so-that-no-two-subset-sums-are-equal/157650"">Number of vectors so that no two subset sums are equal</a> and the optimal number of weighings is known to be asymptotic to</p>

<p>$$\frac{2n}{\log_2{n}}.$$</p>

<p>The linked question contains a reference to <a href=""http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~colt2009/papers/004.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Bshouty</a> where further details and an interesting historical account can be found.  The original paper of Erdős and R\'enyi discussing this coin weighing problem is also <a href=""http://combinatorica.hu/~p_erdos/1963-12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">available</a>.</p>

<p>For a fixed $n$, a (non-adaptive) solution to this coin weighing problem can be written as a $(0,1)$-matrix, with each column corresponding to a coin and each row corresponding to a single weighing. The number of rows is then the number of weighings.   In order for such a matrix to solve the problem, it must not contain any non-zero $n$-dimensional $(-1,0,1)$-vector in its kernel. Clearly, the identity matrix, for example, always satisfies this property and is a trivial solution for any $n$. </p>

<p>In my setting, I would like to solve the same coin weighing problem but I need any solution matrix to be (partial) ciculant. For example, consider $n=4$ and the following partial ciculant solution.</p>

<p>\begin{pmatrix}
0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\\
1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1\\
1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}</p>

<p>This tells us that it is possible to solve the problem with $3$ weighings when $n=4$ and in fact this is optimal. </p>

<p>For this new circulant variant of the coin weighing problem I don't know anything except for particular small values of $n$ where I have manually computed the answer.  However, these results are not particularly revealing except to tell us that the optimal number of weighings is not identical to the general case. For example, the problem can be solved in $7$ weighings for $12$ coins in the general case but you need $8$ weighings for the circulant case.</p>

<p>We know of course that an asymptotic lower bound is still $2n/\log_2{n}$.  But an upper bound seems much less clear. As a first question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the optimal number of weighings sublinear in $n$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is true, then it would very interesting to know if the asymptotics differ from the general case.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the optimal number of weighings still $O(n/\log_2{n})$?</p>

"<p>[Question edited and changed a little on June 14 2015]</p>

<p>Consider an $n$-dimensional vector $v$ with $v_i \in \{-1,1\}$.  Now consider an $n$-dimensional vector $w$ with  $w_i \in \{-1,0,1\}$.  The elements $w_i$ are sampled independently so that $P(w_i = -1) = P(w_i = 1) = 1/4$ and $P(w_i=0) = 1/2$. The elements $v_i$ are sampled independently so that $P(v_i = -1) = P(v_i = 1) = 1/2$.   </p>

<p>Indexing from $0$, we now define $C_i = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j v_{i+j \bmod n}$ to be the  inner product between $w$ and the $i$th rotation of $v$.  It may be helpful to think of both $v$ and $w$ as lying on a discrete circle of circumference $n$ so that the rotation of a vector has a natural visual interpretation. We know that $P(C_i = 0) \sim 1/\sqrt{\pi n}$.</p>

<p>I would like to understand the probability that $C_i = 0$ for many consecutive values of $i$. </p>

<p>To this end we can look at </p>

<p>$$z_i=P(C_i = 0 \mid \forall j &lt; i \; C_j=0 ).$$</p>

<p>Let us define $z_0 = P(C_i = 0) \sim 1/\sqrt{\pi n}$ and we know that $z_{n} = 1$.  With a little effort we can also see that </p>

<p>$$z_1 \sim \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi n}}.$$</p>

<p>The value $z_i$ gives us some indication of the degree of independence of the events $(C_i=0)$.  In particular, my current intuition is that the events $(C_i=0)$ are not too far from being independent for the first few values of $i$ and then once you have a lot of previous zero inner products they become highly dependent. </p>

<p>It appears numerically that $z_2 \sim 2/\sqrt{\pi n}$ although I don't know how to prove this.  This leads to my first question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assuming $n$ is large, for which $i$ can we approximate $z_i$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am particularly interested in $i \leq n/\log_2{n}$. We know that the probability that all $n$ inner products are zero must be at least $2^{-n}$ as that is the probability that $w$ is all zeros. Therefore there cannot be many more than $n/\log_2{n}$  values of $i$ such that $z_i \approx C/\sqrt{n}$.  If there were there would be a contradiction. My guess is that in fact all the first approximately $n/\log_2{n}$ values of $z_i$ are approximately of this form, This leads to my second question. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does there exist a constant $c\geq 1$ so that for all sufficiently large $n$,  $$P{\left(\forall i \leq \frac{n}{\log_2{n}}, C_i = 0\right)} \leq  2^{-\frac{n}{c}}.$$</p>

Why we want to do this  is because if we use Cauchy's formula, 
then the constant $C$ in the estimate will depend on function values of $F$ outside the arc $\gamma$, which are unknown unless an explicit expression for $F$ is derived and also $r$ must depend on the region of analyticity of $F$, which is again not so traceable.

${\cal C}_{x'}\cap {\cal C}_x=\emptyset$ whenever $x \neq x'.$ The cost of an ideal ${\cal C}_x$ is simply </p>

<p>$f({\cal C}_x)=1/x $ </p>

<p>where $x$ is its minimal element. I want to find a collection of disjoint ideals ${\cal M}=\{C_{x_1},\ldots,C_{x_m}\}$ which <strong>maximizes</strong> the cost $$f({\cal M})=\sum_{i=1}^m f(C_{x_i})=\sum_{i=1}^m \frac{1}{x_i}$$ for large $n$.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> There is a side condition to the maximization, which I forgot to write, sorry. To be able to include both $x\neq x'$ in $\cal M$ they must not divide each other in addition to their LCM being strictly greater than $n$. </p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> It seems to me the condition in Edit 1 is superfluous, since if  $LCM(x,x')$ is strictly larger than $n$ the condition of either of $x,x'$ not dividing the other is automatically satisfied. However, subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ where no element of the subset divides another have been investigated for a long time, under the terminology ``primitive sets''. So I suppose I am asking about how small can $f({\cal M})$ be, in comparison to primitive sets which achieve $f$ of $O\left(\frac{\log n}{\sqrt{\log \log n}}\right)$</p>

<p>An upper bound of $\lceil \frac{n+1}{2}\rceil$ is known on the <strong>size</strong> of a collection obeying this LCM condition, see this previous MO question <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/222793/how-large-can-a-subset-of-1-ldots-n-be-if-all-pairwise-lcms-of-its-elemen"">here</a>.
However, the size maximizing sets that are easy to find are essentially mostly integers from $[n/2,n]$ and the value of $f$ they give is constant (since it is $H_n-H_{n/2}$). However, it is known that for so called <strong>primitive sets</strong> in $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ considered by Behrend, Erdos and others (sets of integers satisfying the non-divisibility conditions) the value of $f$ is proved to be asymptotically $\frac{\log n}{\sqrt{\log \log n}}$. </p>

<p>It seems like some pruning of primitive sets by removing their members in $[2,\sqrt{n+1})\cap \mathbb{N}$ and pruning multiples of small primes we should get a collection with cost $f$ possibly not much lower than primitive sets.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong> Could someone summarize Baker's proof? It is frequently referred to and an explanation in English would be wonderful. </p>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong> Formal power series can contain useful information, even if the are divergent. It seems that divergent series are not treated with quite the contempt they used to be.

<p><strong>Question 3</strong> If $g(x)=e^x-1$, $g^n(x), n \in \mathbb{N}$ is the generating function of hierarchies of height n, doesn't $g(x)=e^x-1$, $g^n(x), n \in \mathbb{R}$ consists of labeled rooted trees of fractional height? So shouldn't $f(x)=g^\frac{1}{2}(x)$ be the generating function for labeled rooted trees of height $\frac{1}{2}$?<br>
Doesn't the divergence of $f(x)=g^\frac{1}{2}(x)$ imply that a label rooted tree of height $\frac{1}{2}$ have infinitely many leaves, that the width of the tree is infinite. Can't be use the fact that we are working with a labeled rooted tree to constrain the width of the tree from becoming infinite?</p>

"<p>Inspired by this <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/137109/generating-functions-for-reduced-words"">question</a>, I have been wondering if there are any useful generating functions with all non-zero coefficients equal to one. Obviously, the trivial generating function $\frac{1}{1-x}$ has significant applications, as do monomial symmetric functions but for the purposes of this question, we should ignore them. As Graham has commented, indicator functions also fall into this category. The best formulation I can think of for why these should be ignored is that they are most interesting for the purpose of taking products of generating functions, rather than being directly used for computation.</p>

<p>More specifically, such a generating function would (in my mind) have to be multi-variate, enumerate some object of interest and facilitate computations related to that object in a situation where direct computation is not straightforward. As an example of what I would consider cheating, by specializing many variables to one, the generating function in the aforementioned question allows for computing joint distributions of entries in a reduced word with great ease. However, to compute the generating function, it seems to me one would have to enumerate all such words anyways, hence no labor is saved. Were this not the case, this function would be an excellent example.</p>

<p>What would be an example of such a generating function where computation is assisted without being embedded in constructing the generating function? Even if the generating function serves as a useful book keeping device, that would be okay.</p>

<p>Please comment below with any suggested improvements for what should define a ""useful"" generating function. Explanations for why such a function cannot exist are welcome as well.</p>

<li>Generating functions.</li>
<li>Counting subclasses of labeled trees.</li>
<li>Generalizing to a 3-dimensional array of numbers. There are recurrences on two sets of parallel planes, which intersect in the rows. One set of parallel planes contains the array above, and the other set contains a recurrence from which one can immediately deduce the row sums. Proving that these two different sets of recurrences give the same array is straightforward (albeit tedious without computer algebra) using induction. </li>

<p>The third approach is reminiscent of Wilf and Zeilberger's A = B theory of combinatorial identities, except there you have 3-dimensional arrays with recurrences on <em>three</em> sets of parallel planes. Wilf and Zeilberger's theory does not appear to shed any light on this recurrence.</p>

<p>My question is: does anybody know any other 3-dimensional arrays which have recurrences on two sets of parallel planes, but which do not fall under the A = B theory (so you cannot find a recurrence on a third set of parallel planes)? I would especially be interested in recurrences whose coefficients are polynomials in the coordinates $i,j,k$.</p>

"<p>Let ${\bf N}^\omega = \bigcup_{m=1}^\infty {\bf N}^m$ denote the space of all finite sequences $(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ of natural numbers.  For want of a better name, let me call a family ${\mathcal T} \subset {\bf N}^\omega$ a <em>blocking set</em> if every infinite sequence $N_1,N_2,N_3,N_4,\ldots$ of natural numbers must necessarily contain a blocking set $(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ as an initial segment.  (For the application I have in mind, one might also require that no element of a blocking set is an initial segment of any other element, but this is not the most essential property of these sets.)</p>

<p>One can think of a blocking set as describing a machine that takes a sequence of natural number inputs, but always halts in finite time; one can also think of a blocking set as defining a subtree of the rooted tree ${\bf N}^\omega$ in which there are no infinite paths.  Examples of blocking sets include</p>

<ol>
<li>All sequences $N_1,\ldots,N_m$ of length $m=10$.</li>
<li>All sequences $N_1,\ldots,N_m$ in which $m = N_1 + 1$.</li>
<li>All sequences $N_1,\ldots,N_m$ in which $m = N_{N_1+1}+1$.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason I happened across this concept is that such sets can be used to pseudo-finitise a certain class of infinitary statements.  Indeed, given any sequence $P_m(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ of $m$-ary properties, it is easy to see that the assertion</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There exists an infinite sequence $N_1, N_2, \ldots$ of natural numbers such that $P_m(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ is true for all $m$.</p>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every blocking set ${\mathcal T}$, there exists a finite sequence $(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ in ${\mathcal T}$ such that $P_m(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ holds.</p>

<p>(Indeed, the former statement trivially implies the latter, and if the former statement fails, then a counterexample to the latter can be constructed by setting the blocking set ${\mathcal T}$ to be those finite sequences $(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ for which $P_m(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ fails.)</p>

<p>Anyway, this concept seems like one that must have been studied before, and with a standard name.  (I only used ""blocking set"" because I didn't know the existing name in the literature.)  So my question is: what is the correct name for this concept, and are there some references regarding the structure of such families of finite sequences?  (For instance, if we replace the natural numbers ${\bf N}$ here by a finite set, then by Konig's lemma, a family is blocking if and only if there are only finitely many finite sequences that don't contain a blocking initial segment; but I was unable to find a similar characterisation in the countable case.)</p>

"<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the terminology, I'll explain a little.</p>

<p>The symmetric group $S_n$, as a type A Coxeter group, has generators $\{s_1,\ldots,s_{n-1}\}$ with relations (1) $s_i^2$ for all $i$; (2) $(s_is_j)^2$ for $|i-j|&gt;1$; and (3) $(s_is_j)^3$ for $|i-j|=1$.
For $\pi\in S_n$, we denote by $\ell(\pi)$ the length of a shortest word (product of generators) $s_{i_1}\cdots s_{i_\ell}$ which is equal to $\pi$.
The <em>right weak Bruhat order</em> on $S_n$ is the partial order defined as the transitive closure of the cover relations:
 $\pi&lt;\pi s_i$ if $\ell(\pi)&lt;\ell(\pi s_i)$ for some generator $s_i$.
 For any partially ordered set, we say that a subset $C$ of its elements is <em>convex</em> if, whenever $x,y\in C$ with $x&lt;y$ it happens that the entire interval $[x,y]\subset C$.</p>

<p>If we write our permutations in one-line format, the usual right action of the generator $s_i$ is to swap the entries in positions $i$ and $i+1$.
E.g. if $\pi=632514\in S_6$ in one-line format, then $\pi s_3 = 635214$.
An <em>elementary Knuth transformation</em> associates two permutations which differ by one of these generators under the following conditions, described in terms of their one-line notations:
$$
\ldots xyz \ldots \quad\sim\quad 
\begin{cases}
\;\ldots xzy \ldots &amp;\text{if } y&lt;x&lt;z \text{ or } z&lt;x&lt;y \\
\;\ldots yxz \ldots &amp;\text{if } y&lt;z&lt;x \text{ or } x&lt;z&lt;y 
\end{cases}
$$
For example, $632514\sim 635214$ and $635214\sim 635241$.
The transitive closure of these associations, denoted $\sim$, is called <em>Knuth equivalence</em> or <em>plactic equivalence</em>.</p>

If it is true in general, then is it a known result?
If so, could someone provide a citation?</p>

"<p>Hi. I was reading the paper ""On the foundations of combinatorial theory (VI): The idea of a generating function"" by Doubilet, Rota and Stanley, and there is a relation treated which is very reminiscent of the relation between ideals in a polynomial ring  and affine algebraic varieties (i won't go more specific in the definitions).</p>

<p>It goes as follows (everything quoted from the above paper): Let $P$ be a finite poset (can be generalized to locally finite), and consider its incidence algebra $I(P,K)$, consisting of all the functions from the intervals in $P$ to some field $K$ (of characteristic zero). Sum and product by scalars are inherited from $K$, and product of two functions $f,g \in P$ is defined as the convolution:
\begin{equation}
(f*g)(x,y)=\sum_{x\leq z \leq y}f(x,z)g(z,y)
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Some special elements in $I(P,K)$ needed to state the connection are the units:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\delta_{x,y}(u,v)=\begin{cases}1&amp;\text{if $u=x$ and $v=y$,}\\\\0&amp;\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Now, the (two sided) ideals in this algebra and the <em>varieties</em> have a very nice relation just very similar to the one from commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. But in this case the relation is tighter, because varieties have an algebraic structure coming from a natural partial ordering.</p>

<p>Define the support of and ideal $J$, $\Delta (J)$, as the set of all the units $\delta_{x,y}$ belonging to $J$. It turns out that every ideal $J$ in $I(P,K)$ consists of all the functions $f$ for which $f(x,y)=0$ whenever $\delta_{x,y}\notin \Delta(J) $.
On the other hand, define $Z(J)$ as the set of all intervals $\[ x,y \]$ such that $f(x,y)=0$ for all $f\in J$ (this would be the <em>variety</em>). $Z(J)$ is an order ideal of the poset of all intervals of $P$ (ordered by inclusion).</p>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let $P$ be a finite poset and $S(P)$ the poset of its intervals, ordered by inclusion. Then there is a natural anti-isomorphism between the lattice of ideals of $I(P,K)$ and the lattice of order ideals of $S(P)$.</p>

<p>(For more details and background, check the paper, or ""Enumerative Combinatorics Vol.1"" by Stanley)</p>

"<p>The graph <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_conjecture"">reconstruction conjecture</a> claims that (barring trivial examples) a graph on n vertices is determined (up to isomorphism) by its collection of (n-1)-vertex induced subgraphs (again up to isomorphism).</p>

<p>The way it is phrased (""reconstruction"") suggests that a proof of the conjecture would be a procedure, indeed an algorithm, that takes the collection of subgraphs and then ingeniously ""builds"" the original graph from these.</p>

<p>But based on some experience with a related conjecture (the vertex-switching reconstruction conjecture), I am led to wonder whether this is something that is simply true ""by accident"". By this I mean that it is something that is just overwhelmingly unlikely to be <em>false</em> ... there would need to be a massive coincidence for two non-isomorphic graphs to have the same ""deck"" (as the collection of (n-1)-vertex induced subgraphs is usually called).  In other words, the only <em>reason</em> for the statement to be true is that it ""just happens"" to not be false.</p>

<p>Of course, this means that it could never actually be proved.. and therefore it would be a very poor choice of problem to work on!</p>

<p>My question (at last) is whether anyone has either formalized this concept - results that can't be proved or disproved, not because they are formally undecidable, but just because they are ""true by accident"" - or at least discussed it with more sophistication than I can muster.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Apologies for the delay in responding and thanks to everyone who contributed thoughtfully to the rather vague question. I have accepted Gil Kalai's answer because he most accurately guessed my intention in asking the question. </p>

<p>I should probably not have used the words ""formally unprovable"" mostly because I don't really have a deep understanding of formal logic and while some of the ""logical foundations"" answers contained interesting ideas, that was not really what I was trying to get at.</p>

<p>What I was really trying to get at is that some assertions / conjectures seem <em>to me</em> to be making a highly non-obvious statement about combinatorial objects, the truth of which depends on some fundamental structural understanding that we currently lack. Other assertions / conjectures seem, again, <em>to me</em>, to just be saying something that we would simply expect to be true ""by chance"" and that we would really be astonished if it were false.</p>

<p>Here are a few unproved statements all of which I believe to be true: some of them I think should reflect structure and others just seem to be ""by chance"" (which is which I will answer later, if anyone is still interested in this topic).</p>

<p>(1) Every projective plane has prime power order</p>

<p>(2) Every non-desarguesian projective plane contains a Fano subplane</p>

<p>(3) The graph reconstruction conjecture</p>

<p>(4) Every vertex-transitive cubic graph has a hamilton cycle (except Petersen, Coxeter and two related graphs) </p>

<p>(5) Every 4-regular graph with a hamilton cycle has a second one</p>

<p>Certainly there is a significant chance that I am wrong, and that something that <em>appears</em> accidental will eventually be revealed to be a deep structural theorem when viewed in exactly the right way. However I have to choose what to work on (as do we all) and one of the things I use to decide what <em>NOT</em> to work on is whether I believe the statement says something real or accidental.</p>

<p>Another aspect of Gil's answer that I liked was the idea of considering a ""finite version"" of each statement: let S(n) be the statement that ""all non-desarguesian projective planes of order at most n have a Fano subplane"". Then suppose that all the S(n) are true, and that for any particular n, we can find a proof - in the worst case, ""simply"" enumerate all the projective planes of order n and check each for a Fano subplane. But suppose that the length of the shortest possible proof of S(n) tends to infinity as n tends to infinity - essentially there is NO OTHER proof than checking all the examples. Then we could never make a finite length proof covering all n. This is roughly what I would mean by ""true by accident"".</p>

"<p>One of Barany's most intriguing conjectures is about the $f$-vectors of convex polytopes. It asks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $P$ be a convex $d$-polytope. Is it always true that $f_k \geq \min(f_0, f_{d-1})$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <strong><em>convex $d$-polytope</em></strong> is the convex hull of finitely many vertices $v_1, \ldots, v_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$. A <strong><em>face</em></strong> of the polytope is whatever you can shave off with a hyperplane. Its dimension is the dimension of the affine hull it generates. The number of faces are collected in the so-called $f$-vector $f = (f_0, \ldots, f_{d-1})$, where $f_k$ denotes the number of $k$-dimensional faces. Further information on polytopes can be found in Ziegler's ""Lectures on Polytopes"".</p>

<p>My question is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's the status of Barany's conjecture? For which classes of polytopes is it known to hold?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is what I know:</p>

<p>By double counting it is easy to see that the conjecture is true for simple and simplicial polytopes. Furthermore, it is nothing but a boring calculation to prove that the basic polytope constructions like taking products, prisms, pyramids, etc. retain the the conjectured inequality.</p>

<p>Given that the face lattice of a convex $d$-polytope is a graded, atomic, coatomic lattice of rank $d+2$, it makes sense to ask a far more general question: Given such a lattice, denote the number of elements of the $k$th level again by $f_k$. Is it still true that $f_k \geq \min(f_0, f_{d-1})$? Here the answer is no since I was able to construct a counterexample. But if the lattice also has what Ziegler calls the ""diamond property"" (every interval of length two looks like a diamond), then I don't know the answer.</p>

"<p>Here's a mathematical modeling problem I came across while working on a hobby project.</p>

<p>I have a website that presents each visitor with a list of movie titles. The user has to rank them from most to least favorite. After each visit, I want to create a cumulative ranking that takes into account each visitor's individual ranking. Normally I would just take the mean ordinal rank: e.g., if Person A rated ""Avatar"" 10th and Person B rated it 20th, its cumulative rank would be 15th. However, new movies will be added to the list as the website grows, so each person will have ranked only a subset of the full movie list.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on how I can define ""average rank"" when some rankings do not cover the whole set? My best idea so far is to model this as a directed graph, where nodes are movies and weighted edges are preferences (e.g. ""10 people ranked 'Avatar' right above 'District 9'""), and then finding sinks and sources. How else could one go about this?</p>

<p>Now consider you want to properly edge color your graph such that no 5-path is bi-colored and denote this number by $\beta'(G).$ Repeating the same argument with entropy compression one obtains an upper bound of order $O(\Delta(G)^{1.5})$ for $\beta'(G).$</p>

<li>Can we compute $m$ in polynomial time?</li>

<p>The interesting case (for my application, anyway) occurs when $n\gg k$ (so there are many common subexpressions) but the semigroup is noncommutative (so you cannot simply rearrange terms and use repeated doubling).</p>

<p>Let me outline one simple (but insufficient) approach.  Suppose that we begin by computing all products of (not necessarily distinct) pairs from $A$.  Then we can compute $p$ with $k^2+(\lceil n/2 \rceil -1)$ multiplications by multiplying the terms two at a time.  If $k^2\ll n$, then we have essentially halved the number of multiplications.  Analogous reasoning can be extended to provide roughly an $\lfloor \log_k(n)-\log_k(\log_k(n)) \rfloor -1$ improvement in the number of multiplications.  However, for highly repetitive strings we could do much better still.</p>

$f: V \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_{\le m}(C) $, a function that maps each vertex to a subset of colors of size $\le m$. <br/>
We define the set of edges of the graph as:
$E := \big\lbrace \small\{ \normalsize v_i, v_j, c_k \small\} \normalsize \mid c_k \in f(v_i) \cap f(v_j) \big\rbrace$, i.e. there is an edge colored with a given color between every pair of vertices that share that color. Note that a pair of vertices may have more than one edge if they share multiple colors.</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that every pair of vertices has at least one edge in common. i.e. $\forall v_i, v_j \in V$  there exists $c_k \in C$ such that $\{v_i, v_j, c_k\} \in E$.</p>

<p>Define $F(n,m) = s$ such that for any graph with $n$ vertices, each vertex colored with $\le m$ colors as above, there is a clique of order $s$ where each edge is colored with the same color. Another way of phrasing this is that there is a subset of size $s$, $S \subseteq V$, $|S| = s$, all vertices of which share a color. i.e. $\exists c_k \in C$ such that $\forall v_i \in S, c_k \in f(v_i)$.</p>

<p>Given a subset of the rows of $A$ it is possible to check in polynomial time whether they already span $span(A)$. Hence one can determine whether a given row subset is minimal (with regard to inclusion) with the property that it spans the row space of $A$ (simply try removing any row and see if the result still spans the row space of $A$). But since we work over the integers, it is possible that there are other, strictly smaller row subsets with the same property. As an example, consider the ""vectors"" 2, 3 and 1. Then {2,3} and {1} both are minimal generating sets for $\mathbb{Z}$ of differing size. This leads to my first question:</p>

where $n=\lfloor{N/2}\rfloor$. In fact, as was pointed out by Schmidt, the existence of this onto group homomorphism implies that $H$ is imprimitive.</p>

<p>In general, one cannot rule out the existence of such an $H$. For example 
one could have $H=S_n\ltimes\mathbf{F}_2^n$ where $N$ is even and $n=\frac{N}{2}$.
We let $H$ act on $T$ in the following way: We divide $T$ in $n$ disjoint blocks of size $2$. We let $S_n$ permute the $n$ blocks without swapping the pair in each block, and we let $\mathbf{F}_2^n$ permute (resp. acts like the identity) the two elements in the i-th block if the i-th coordinate of an element $\sigma\in \mathbf{F}_2^n$ is $\overline{1}$ (resp. $\overline{0}$). It thus follows that $H$ acts transitively (but imprimitively) on $T$.</p>

<p>Furthermore, suppose that I can produce "" a lot of elements "" in  $H$ which contain a cycle of length $r$ in their cycle presentations (their writing as a product of disjoint cycles of $T$) for $r&gt;n$. Then may I conclude that such an $H$ does not exist?</p>

<p>Q1: Is there some kind of results that would allow me to conclude that $H\supseteq A_N$, so that this would contradict the imprimitivity and therefore rule out the existence of such an $H$?</p>

<p>For example here is one key result which is good to know: if $H$ is assumed to be primitive and contains a cycle of length $\ell$ with $2\leq \ell\leq N-7$ ($\ell$ not necessarily prime) then combining classical results on permutation group theory one may show that $H\supseteq A_N$. However, since in my setting $H$ is imprimitive I cannot apply this result.</p>

"<h2>Question</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there efficient algorithms to check if a finite simplicial complex defined in terms of its maximal facets is shellable? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By efficient here I am willing to consider anything with smaller expected complexity than the exponential mess one gets by naively testing all possible orderings of maximal facets.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Let $\Delta$ be a simplicial complex and for each simplex $\sigma \in \Delta$ let $\bar{\sigma}$ denote the subcomplex generated by $\sigma$ and all its faces. Fix an ordering of its maximal facets $F_1,\ldots,F_K$, pick some $k \in \lbrace 1,\ldots,K\rbrace$ and define $\Delta_k$ to be the subcomplex generated by $\bigcup_{1\leq j \leq k} F_j$, i.e., all facets up to and incluing the $k$-th one. </p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> We call this ordering of maximal facets a <em>shelling</em> if the intersection $\overline{F_{k+1}} \cap \Delta_k$ is a simplicial complex of dimension $\dim (F_{k+1}) - 1$ for each $k \in \lbrace 1,\ldots,K-1\rbrace$.</p>

<p>In general, the complex $\Delta$ need not be a combinatorial manifold or have a uniform top dimension for its maximal facets. It is known that <em>if</em> $\Delta$ is shellable <em>then</em> there exists a shelling by maximal facets ordered so that the dimension is decreasing along the order. So one method to simplify the computational burden is to test only those orderings $F_1,\ldots,F_K$ of maximal facets so that $\dim F_i \geq \dim F_j$ whenever $i \leq j$, but of course in the worst case all these facets could have the same dimension.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelling_%28topology%29"">Shellability</a> is an extremely useful notion in topological combinatorics: many interesting simplicial complexes and posets in this field turn out to be shellable. I refer you to the works of Anders Bjorner and others for details, see <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/1999359"">here</a> or <a href=""http://www.combinatorics.org/Volume_16/PDF/v16i2r1.pdf"">here</a> or... Since every shellable complex is a wedge of spheres, establishing shellability leads to all sorts of interesting conclusions. Among other things, shellable complexes must lack torsion in homology of all dimensions.</p>

<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: 
Frankl's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union-closed_sets_conjecture"">union closed sets conjecture</a> has an equivalent phrasing in terms of lattices. It says that in every finite lattice there is a join irreducible element which is less than or equal to at most half the elements in the lattice. </p>

If it is true, then one can prove the 4-color theorem by means of Kempe exchanges alone for all internally 6-connected planar triangulations other than the icosahedron. The reason for the failure of Kempe exchanges in the case of the icosahedron lies with the coloring property that I described in my previously posted question. The article referenced above discusses this topic by means of equivalence classes under Kempe exchanges.</p>

sequence could be either <a href=""https://oeis.org/A099190"">https://oeis.org/A099190</a> or <a href=""https://oeis.org/A176747"">https://oeis.org/A176747</a>.

For example for $n=7$ computer found $C$ such that $|C|=20$. Also better results were found for $n=8,9,10$.</p>

"<p>This question is pretty simple to state: given two linear functions on a polygon, I'm looking for a formula for the integral of their product which depends only on the values at the (unlabelled) edges and on the shape of the polygon. However, the motivation comes from a problem I've been investigating for a while, so I thought I might as well elaborate for the sake of context (the previous question in the series is <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/78996"">here</a>). My understanding of the problem is gradually progressing, and with it the way in which I formulate it. Quick recap:</p>

<p>I'm interested in variations of piecewise linear surfaces in ℝ<sup>3</sup> (which need not be triangulated). Fixing the ""combinatorial type"" of a surface - i.e. the way vertices, edges and faces are joined together - I have found that the space of variations has dimension E + 3χ, with E the number of edges and χ the Euler characteristic. For surfaces homeomorphic to a sphere, we get E+6 with 6 dimensions corresponding to translations and rotations.</p>

<p>I would like to find an inner product on the space of variations, with the following caveat. There are operations which change the combinatorial structure of a surface but not its actual shape - such as adding a ""flat"" edge across a non-triangular face, or an edge of zero length at a vertex where more than three faces meet. In such cases there is a natural inclusion of the variations of the original surface into the variations of the new one, and I would like my inner product to be preserved under this inclusion.</p>

<p>I've been proceeding by analogy with the smooth case: each variation induces a unique normal vector field on every face, so we can take the pointwise product of these and then integrate. This inner product is intuitively consistent in the sense described in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>Because variations must preserve linearity of the faces, the vector fields are linear on each face - so we can write them, and their product, in terms of the vertices or edges. In particular, for a triangular face the inner product is the average of the (pointwise) products on the centres of the edges, multiplied by the area of the face.</p>

<p>This is promising: for triangulated surfaces, I now have an expression which depends only on the edges. But I'm having trouble extending this to non-triangular faces. I've tried triangulating a polygon in various specific and generic ways, and so far all I've got is a mess. But maybe I'm being stupid. Any suggestions?</p>

"<p>Consider the general polynomial $P_1(t) = \prod_{j=1}^n (t+x_j)$.
Construct $P_k(t) = \prod_{\sigma \subset [n], |\sigma|=k} (t+x_{\sigma_1}x_{\sigma_2}\cdots x_{\sigma_k})$
where the product is over all subsets of size $k$ of the numbers $1,2,\dots,n.$
The coefficients of $P_1(t)$ will be the elementary symmetric polynomials in $x_1,\dots,x_n$
and it is easy to argue that the coefficients in $P_k(t)$ are polynomials in
the coefficients of $P_1.$</p>

<p>Now, my question is rather vague but I seek references to areas where these types of polynomials appear. I suspect they are related somehow to Schur-polynomials,
representation theory, and determinants of band-matrices.</p>

"<p>An interval graph is an intersection graph of real intervals, that is, an undirected graph whose vertices can be labeled with real intervals so that there is an edge between two vertices iff their intervals intersect.</p>

<p>A comparability graph is an undirected graph that connects elements that are comparable in some partial order, i.e., it is a graph whose edges can be oriented in such a way that the resulting binary relation is transitive and antisymmetric.</p>

<p>Given any interval graph, $G$, it is known that its complement is a comparability graph, and in particular, the comparability graph of an interval order, that is, a strict partial order on intervals where $[x,y] &lt; [z,w]$ iff $y &lt; z$. Our question asks in what cases the complement of a comparability graph is also a comparability graph for some order.</p>

<p>For example, consider the case where vertices are identified with intervals and an edge is drawn when one interval is a subset of another but shares no endpoints. This forms a comparability graph for the so-called ""interval containment"" order, and we know that its complement is also a comparability graph for a product order on $\mathbb{R}^2$. </p>

<p>So, our general question is: under what conditions is the complement of a comparability graph also a comparability graph? We have a more particular example in mind and that is when the comparability graph is that of an interval order (as defined above) for all intervals in a range from 1 to some given N. The complement of this graph is clearly an interval graph (since in the complement, intervals are connected if they intersect). And one can think of this as a ""complete"" interval graph as all intervals in a range are represented. The question is: is it also a comparability graph?</p>

<p>In this question, we look at a generalization. Suppose we have an arbitrary graph $G$ on $n$ vertices. Is there a ""big enough"" value of $\delta$ so that any two vertices not connected by an edge must share a common neighbor (i.e. if $k\cdot \delta &gt;n$, this property holds). </p>

$$

I am going to find $x$ and $P$ such that these equalities are satisfied:
$$

$$

<p>$$
f(l) = \sum_{d=0}^{N-1} \underbrace{\sum_{(i,j) \in S_d} x_i x_j}_{g[d]} \space w^{ld}

$$
S =S_1 \cup S_2 \cup \cdots \cup S_{N-1} =  \{(i,j), \quad 1\leq i,j \leq K, \quad i \ne j \}

$$</p>

<p>i.e. the problem becomes finding partition(s) of $S$ and $\{x_i\}_{k=1}^K$ (up to a scale!) satisfying the above equalities.</p>

<p>If for simplicity we set the values $x_1=x_2=\cdots=x_K = 1$, the problem will reduce to this:</p>

<p>$$
|S_d|=\frac{K(K-1)}{N-1}, \quad d=1,2,\cdots,N-1
$$
so, for the case of $\frac{K(K-1)}{N-1}$ being integer, the solution for $x$ and cardinality of partitions is found. Any idea for the case it is not integer?
Even finding cardinality of partitions would be great!</p>

<p>Any contribution would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Edit: I reached the result that the solution of this problem for $|S_d|$ is $\{|S_d|\}$ with minimum variance under constraint of $\sum_{d=1}^{N-1}|S_d| = K(K-1)$ which leads to some of them being $\lfloor \frac{K(K-1)}{N-1}\rfloor$ and the others $\lfloor \frac{K(K-1)}{N-1}\rfloor+1$.</p>

"<p>It is well known that isoperimetric inequalities on a hypercube are closely related to influences, but all the theorems I'm aware of deal with monotone sets. Now suppose we have an arbitrary set $X \subset \{0, 1\}^n$, and let us color all vertices of a hypercube that lie in $X$ in black, others in white. The boundary edges (which have their endpoints colored in different colors), are of two types: going in positive direction we either go from white to black (positive influence) or from black to white (negative influence).

<h2>Variation</h2>

<p>Consider the same greedy algorithm when you impose the condition that $f(m)=0$ unless $m$ is square free. (If $m$ is not square free $f$ is multiplicative and has values $\pm1$.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question: How does our greedy algorithm performs on the square-free version?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Namely, we would like to understand the behavior of the discrepancy of the function obtained by our greedy algorithm. While for EDP there are known examples with $\log N$ discrepancy, this is not known for the square-free version.</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>The very nice answer by rlo suggests that the greedy algorithm gives discrepancy close to $n^{1/3}$ or so, and rlo expects it also for the square free variation. Can an upper bound of $N^{1/2-\epsilon}$ be proved? What about a lower bound of $N^{\epsilon}$. Another interesting question is if you can improve the greedy algorithm to get lower discrepancy. Our greedy ignore 0's in intervals. A greedy algorithm that ignore intervals with 0's was considered in polymath5 and to the best of my memory achieve discrepancy $n^{1/2}$. Maybe a clever interpolation between these two variants will do a better job than both? </p>

<h2>Further meditation and a new variant</h2>

<p>It seems that in our greedy algorithm the decisions we make for small primes are fairly irrelevant. A way to check it: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Run the algorithm for N and test what is the discrepancy for an interval [1,T] where T is, 
  say, $\sqrt N$. I would expect the answer to be roughly $\sqrt T$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now we can think about the following variation: </p>

<p>Let $a&gt;1$ be a real number. We run the greedy algorithm above but our decision for $f(p)$ is based only on intervals $[1,n]$ where $n \le p^a$. (Of course we consider only $n \le N$. </p>

Of course these families are also the settings in which the most famous growth statements have been proven (cf. work of Helfgott, Pyber, Szabo, Breuillard, Green, Tao, Bourgain, Katz and many others), so perhaps this is not surprising. Note, though, that the bounds connected to width (i.e. multiplication by conjugates) are much stronger than those given by growth so the connection between the two is not entirely obvious...</p>

"<p>I'm reading <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/3642743439"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Distance Regular Graphs</em></a> by Brouwer, Cohen, and Neumaier. In section 1.8, they explained <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HadamardGraph.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Hadamard graphs</a>.</p>

<h2>Conversion from a Hadamard Matrix into a Hadamard Graph</h2>

<p>An $n$-Hadamard graph $G$ is a graph on $4n$ vertices defined in terms of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_matrix"" rel=""nofollow"">Hadamard matrix</a> of order $n$ $H_n = h_{ij}$ as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define $4n$ symbols $r_i^+$, $r_i^-$, $c_i^+$, and $c_i^-$, where $r$ stands for <em>row</em> and $c$ stands for <em>column</em> and take these as the vertices of the graph.</li>
<li>Then add two types of edges between row vertices and column vertices based on the sign of $h_{ij}$:
\begin{equation*}
\text{parallel edges $(r_i^+, c_j^+)$ and $(r_i^-, c_j^-)$ if $h_{ij} = +1$} \\
\text{crossing edges $(r_i^+, c_j^-)$ and $(r_i^-, c_j^+)$ if $h_{ij} = -1$}
\end{equation*}</li>
</ol>

<p>Then the graph $G$ will be a bipartite graph where the set of vertices is partitioned into <em>row vertex set</em> of $2n$ vertices and <em>column vertex set</em> of $2n$ vertices. And there will be $2n^2$ edges.</p>

<h2>Equivalence between Graph and Matrix</h2>

<p>In theorem 1.8.1 in their book, they showed that $G$ is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-regular_graph"" rel=""nofollow"">distance-regular graph</a> with an intersection array
$\{n,n-1,\frac{n}{2},1;1,\frac{n}{2},n-1,n\}$ if and only if the matrix $H$ is Hadamard matrix of order $n$. </p>

<h2>My Question</h2>

<p>Their proof of this theorem seems rather brief and I have hard time in understanding the equivalence. Especially, I don't understand what role two orthogonal rows or columns in the matrix $H_n$ play in the graph $G$ so that distance-regularity is achieved. The book cited three papers for the proof, but I cannot find any of them in the Internet.</p>

"<p>A partition regular system is a linear system of equations of the form $A\cdot x=0$, which satisfies a Ramsey-type result (namely, that for each $r&gt;0$ whenever we colour the integers in $r$ classes, there is a class which contains a monochromatic solution). The well-known Rado's theorem gives a characterization of such matrices, but we are not interested on this here.</p>

<p>An strong condition of this notion is density regular: a matrix $A$ is density regular if for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $Y\subset \{1,\dots,n\}$ with $|Y| \geq \varepsilon n$, then $Y$ contains a solution to the equation $A\cdot x=0$. This is the strong counterpart of Rado's theorem, and it was proven by Frankl, Rödl and Graham that $A$ is density regular iff the vector $x=(1,\dots, 1)$ is a solution of the system (namely, the columns vectors of $A$ sum 0). For instance, the matrix equation associated to $k$-APs satisfies this condition, so Szemerédi's theorem is covered by this result.</p>

"<p>There are a collection of definitions of ""combinatorial Euler characteristic"", which is different from the ""homotopy Euler characteristic"".  I will describe a few of them and give some references, and then ask how far they can be generalized.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A good place to start is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadwiger%27s_theorem"">Hadwiger's theorem</a>.  Define a ""Hadwiger measure"" <em>m</em> on <strong>R</strong><sup>n</sup> to be a thing that assigns (possibly negative) real numbers to (nice?) subsets of <strong>R</strong><sup>n</sup> in such a way that the assignment is invariant under rigid transformations (i.e. isometries) and satisfies the ""inclusion-exclusion"" principle that <em>m</em>(_A_ &cup; <em>B</em>) = <em>m</em>(_A_) + <em>m</em>(_B_) - <em>m</em>(_A_ &cap; <em>B</em>); Hadwidger measures are also required to satisfy some analytic properties.  Then Hadwidger proves that the space of measures on <strong>R</strong><sup>n</sup> is precisely (<em>n</em>+1)-dimensional, and has a basis <i>m<sub>i</sub></i> with <i>m<sub>i</sub></i>([0,1]<sup>i</sup>) = 1 and <i>m<sub>i</sub></i>(&lambda; <em>A</em>) = &lambda;<sup>i</sup> <i>m<sub>i</sub></i>(<em>A</em>), where &lambda; <em>A</em> is the set rescaled by a factor of &lambda; in every direction.  In particular, <i>m</i><sub>0</sub> of a finite set counts the number of points, and agrees with Euler characteristic for compact regions; the function <i>m</i><sub>0</sub> is the ""combinatorial Euler characteristic"".  It is not homotopy-invariant: <i>m</i><sub>0</sub>([0,1]) = 1 whereas <i>m</i><sub>0</sub>(<strong>R</strong>) = -1.  It is multiplicative.<br><br>Incidentally, Hadwiger's paper is in German and so I cannot read it.  Apparently all this material is in Rota's book ""Introduction to Geometric Probability"", but I have been away from a library and haven't read it yet.  Thus I don't know the precise statement of ""nice"".</p></li>
<li><p>Schanuel in MR1173024 various ""geometric categories"".  Namely, say that a subset of <strong>R</strong><sup>n</sup> is a ""polyhedron"" if it is the positive locus finitely many affine maps to <strong>R</strong>; close the collection of polyhedra under union, intersection, and complement, and thus recover the notion of ""polyhedral set"" (so that a polyhedral set is actually a pair (<em>n</em>,_S_) where <em>S</em> is a subset of <strong>R</strong><sup>n</sup> satisfying certain properties).  Then  morphism of polyhedral sets is a set-theoretic function whose graph (as a subset of <strong>R</strong><sup>n</sup> x <strong>R</strong><sup>m</sup>) is polyhedral.  Then it's straightforward to check that a morphism is an isomorphism if it is a set-theoretic bijection &mdash; morphisms allow gluing and cutting.<br><br>Or replace the word ""affine"" with ""polynomial"" and thus recover the notion of ""semi-algebraic set"".  Or restrict your attention to bounded polyhedral sets.  Anyway, each of these geometric categories has well-behaved product and coproduct, and so a ""Burnside Rig"" (ring without negation) whose elements are isomorphism classes of objects.  Schanuel computes each of these Burnside rigs, and shows that the universal cancelative quotient of each is the integers; this map to <strong>Z</strong> is the combinatorial Euler characteristic.</p></li>
<li><p>Apparently there are also more analytic definitions.  Schanuel in MR842922 (wonderful but only trying to develop intuition and motivation) suggests that each of the Hadwiger measures can be defined in terms of curvatures and whatnot, but the formulas he gives only make sense for compact manifolds (with boundaries, corners...).<br><br>Chen (MR1215324) describes the combinatorial Euler characteristic with the following fun integral: let <em>f</em>: <strong>R</strong> &rarr; <strong>R</strong> be continuous except for finitely many jump and/or removable discontinuities, and define &int;<sub>Euler</sub>f = &Sigma;<sub><i>x</i>&isin;<strong>R</strong></sub> [ f(x) - (1/2) (f(x<sup>+</sup>) + f(x<sup>-</sup>)) ]; then try to compute Euler integrals of characteristic functions.  The problem is that he then defines the multi-dimensional version via the Fubini theorem, but suggests that his integrals depend on a choice of basis.</p></li>
<li><p>The definition of combinatorial Euler characteristic is great for ""finite polyhedral complexes"", I think.  By a ""finite polyhedral complexes"" I mean glue together finitely many polyhedra, but you're allowed to leave some faces open, so that unlike a CW complex not every cell must have complex closure.  Then you can calculate Euler characteristic with the usual formula: (number of cells of even dimension) - (number of cells of odd dimension).  I think this is a topological (but not homotopy!) invariant.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, so first, are there references I've missed?</p>

<p>Second and more importantly, all the references consider only subsets of Euclidean space (well, Schanuel briefly mentions the Burnside rig of varieties/<strong>C</strong>, but only computes a quotient).  Why?  Why isn't there an intrinsic topological description, or perhaps manifold-theoretic description?</p>

<p>In particular, a ""measure-theoretic"" version that does not rely on embeddings in Euclidean space would be great, as it would presumably give ""measures"" against which we could integrate smooth functions.  Any ideas?</p>

<p>I'm attempting to solve one of the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php?puzzle_id=12"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook engineering puzzles</a>.  Essentially, the idea is that two dancers do a dance-off with a predefined number of moves.  For every turn, the dancer has to begin with the last move the other dancer used.  Every time a combination of moves is used, both that combination and its reverse are excluded.  For instance, if you do (1, 2), then neither dancer can do (1, 2) or (2, 1).  Dancers may repeat moves.  The dancers will dance optimally, and the battle is over when there are no more moves left.</p>

<p>My first thought when trying to solve this went like this:  the dancers are essentially building a B(n, 2) de Bruijn sequence.  The length of the sequence should be n^2.  I figured that if the number of turns is odd, then you win.  If the number of turns is even, then they win.  Thus since n^2 will be odd if n is odd, and n^2 will be even if n is even, all I did was check to see if it was odd or even to determine the winner.  This wasn't the correct answer.</p>

<p>So here's my current way of thinking:  the dancers are going through a de Bruijn graph.  For every turn, two vertices are considered visited <em>unless</em> it is a duplicate (like (1, 1) or (2,2)).  Therefore, the number of turns available would be 2^n - n.  But this just seems like a more complex way to do the same thing as I was doing above.  After all 2^n will always yield a positive, so this will yield an even if n is even and an odd if n is odd.</p>

<p>I don't really want to ask anyone to solve this for me (I want to solve it on my own).  But can someone at least tell me if I'm on the right path, or is there something fundamental I'm missing?</p>

"<p>I'm looking at a random bipartite graph $K_{\omega(n)}*K_{\omega(n)}$ where $\mathrm{log}(n)\leq \omega(n) \leq n^{1/2}$, in which each of the $\omega(n)^{2}$ edges is placed randomly with probability $p=\frac{\mathrm{log}(n)}{\omega(n)^{2}}$. Now i know the threshold for an isolated vertex is an $n \times n$ random bipartite graph is $p(n)=\frac{\mathrm{log}(n)}{n}$ i thought since $\omega(n)^{2} \leq n$ perhaps in my case as the probability for an edge was larger i might find a similar thing, but i think not.

<p>For any vertex $v$ in $K_{\omega(n)} \times K_{\omega(n)}$ let $X(v)$ be the indicator random variable with $X(v)=1$ if $v$ is isolated and $X(v)=0$ otherwise. It follows that $P(X(v)=1)=\left(1-\frac{\mathrm{log}(n)}{\omega(n)^{2}}\right)^{\omega(n)} \approx e^{-\frac{\mathrm{log}(n)}{\omega(n)}}=\frac{1}{n^{1/\omega(n)}}=O(1)$ </p>

<p>Thus the probability that a vertex $v$ is isolated is constant as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and so it is very likely that there will be an isolated vertex. Is this arguement valid in proving we have an isolated vertex in the regime i have described. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Let $G$ be a finite abelian group such that the sum of all elements of $G$ is zero. Let $n\neq 1$ be an integer such that $n\mid \left|G\right|-1$.

<p>I am looking for a proof of a conjecture I made.  I need to give two definitions. For distinct real numbers $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$, define $\sigma(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k) =1$ if $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k)$ is an even permutation of an increasing sequence, and $\sigma(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k) =-1$ if $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k)$ is an odd permutation of an increasing sequence. For example, $\sigma(2, 1, 10, 8) = 1$ because $(2,1,10,8)$ is an even permutation of $(1,2,8,10)$, and $\sigma(2, 1, 8, 10) = -1$ because $(2,1,8,10)$ is an odd permutation of $(1,2,8,10)$.  For real $B$, $n\geq 1$ and distinct real numbers $\mu_1, \mu_2, \ldots, \mu_n, \gamma_1, \gamma_2, \ldots, \gamma_n$, let $M(B;\mu_1,\mu_2,\ldots,\mu_n;\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\ldots,\gamma_n)$ be the $n$-by-$n$ matrix defined by </p>

<p>$$ M(B;\mu_1,\mu_2,\ldots,\mu_n;\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\ldots,\gamma_n)_{i,j}=\frac{\exp(-B\gamma_j)}{\mu_i+\gamma_j}+\frac{\exp(B\gamma_j)}{\mu_i-\gamma_j}.        $$</p>

<p>My conjecture is the following: if $n \geq 1$, $B \geq 0$, and $\mu_1, \mu_2, \ldots, \mu_n, \gamma_1, \gamma_2, \ldots, \gamma_n$ are distinct <em>positive</em> numbers with 
$0&lt;\mu_1 &lt; \mu_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; \mu_n$ and $0&lt;\gamma_1 &lt; \gamma_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; \gamma_n$ , then</p>

<p>$$\operatorname{sgn}(\operatorname{det}(M(B;\mu_1,\mu_2,\ldots,\mu_n;\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\ldots,\gamma_n))) = (-1)^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}
           \sigma(\mu_1, \mu_2, \ldots, \mu_n, \gamma_1, \gamma_2, \ldots, \gamma_n). $$</p>

<p>Of course $\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ is the sign of $x$, which is $1$, $-1$, or $0$. I have proven this is true for $n=1$ and $n=2$.  For $n$ between $3$ and $20$, I have run thousands of experiments in Matlab using randomly generated $\mu$'s and $\gamma$'s.  In a set of one thousand experiments, the conjectured equation will typically hold every single time, or might fail once or twice, with the determinant (with the wrong sign) being extremely small, so perhaps roundoff error is the culprit.</p>

<p>UPDATE: let $d(B)$ be the determinant of the matrix, where the other parameters should be clear from context.  $d(B)$ is an analytic function of $B$.  It suffices to show that $\frac{\partial^m d}{\partial B^m}$ has the desired sign at $B=0$ for all $m \geq 0$.  Unfortunately, the determinant of $\frac{\partial M}{\partial B}$ is not the same thing as $\frac{\partial^m d}{\partial B^m}$ (if it were, properties of Cauchy matrices would yield the desired conclusion).  Since the conjecture is true for  $n=1$, that means that the displayed formula for $M_{i,j}$ above, and all its derivatives with respect to $B$, have the same sign as $\mu_i - \gamma_j$ at $B=0$, and $M_{i,j}$ has that sign for all positive $B$.  I proved the conjecture for $n=2$, by computing the determinant of $M$ and its derivatives with respect to $B$ at $B=0$, and looking at the six possible orderings of $\mu_1, \mu_2, \gamma_1$, and $\gamma_2$ given the restrictions $\mu_1 &lt; \mu_2$ and $\gamma_1 &lt; \gamma_2$.  I had some help from Maple multiplying out, simplifying and factoring algebraic expressions.  I am trying to prove the general case by induction on $n$, expanding the determinant along the last row or column, but the determinants of the $n-1$-by-$n-1$ minors don't seem to necessarily have the ``right'' signs.</p>

<p>Thanks to some comments provided below, unless I am confused, the conjecture can be proven for $B=0$ and large positive $B$, for any $n$, using properties of Cauchy matrices.</p>

I am incorporating the following clarification that I made in a comment responding to the answer of Anna Varvak:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In inclusion-exclusion, one alternately adds and subtracts intersections. Intersections measure the degree to which disjointness fails. Can we write the right-hand side of Bayes Theorem as alternate multiplications and divisions of something, where ""something"" measures the degree to which independence fails?</p>

"<p>I think this is a natural question but am not sure where to find resources.</p>

<p>Consider the possible multisets arising from choosing $n$ times an item from one of $k$ categories. We can represent one such multiset by a vector $\vec{x} = (x_1,\dots,x_k)$ with $\sum_i x_i = n$.</p>

<p>This is equivalent to</p>

<p>$$ k^n \mathbb{E} \left[ x_1^{x_1} \cdots x_k^{x_k} \right] $$</p>

<p>where the expectation is over $\vec{x}$ as the outcome of a uniform multinomial distribution ($n$ draws and $k$ equally likely categories). I'd rather not assume that either $k$ or $n$ is large with respect to the other (or assume both; both cases are interesting).</p>

<p><strong>My approaches so far.</strong></p>

<p>If we are sloppy about how many $x_i$ are nonzero (for instance if $n \gg k$) then we expect most cases have all $x_i &gt; 1$, and we can use Stirling's approximation for all of the factorials. (If this is not the case, we have to be more careful and talk about only the nonzero $x_i$, so the below is not correct as stated, but hopefully can be modified.) We get that our sum is
\begin{align} 
 &amp;\approx \sum_{\vec{x}} \frac{\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n \sqrt{2\pi n}}{\left(\frac{x_1}{e}\right)^{x_1} \cdots \left(\frac{x_k}{e}\right)^{x_k} \sqrt{\left(2\pi x_1\right)\cdots\left(2\pi x_k\right)}} x_1^{x_1} \cdots x_k^{x_k}  \\
 &amp;= \frac{n^n}{(2\pi)^{(k-1)/2}} \sum_{\vec{x}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x_1 \cdots x_k}}
\end{align}</p>

<p>Perhaps this sum can be approximated by an integral or volume of some sort? (Again, it is over all vectors $\vec{x}$ consisting of natural numbers and summing to $n$.) But I'm not sure how to do so, it got messy fast for me.</p>

<p>Another thought I had is to say that ""most"" vectors $\vec{x}$ have each $x_i \approx \Theta\left(\frac{n}{k}\right)$ (again being careful about regimes where many $x_i = 0$), and go from there. But I couldn't bound the contributions from the ""tail"" well.</p>

The answer given is $2^{n-1}$ since having more than that allows a two member partition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: can every partition-free family be enlarged to one of this size?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is an interesting comparison to <strong>Intersecting Families</strong> (ones which contain no two disjoint members.) Here again the maximal size is $2^{n-1}$ because we never can have both a set and its complement. Any intersecting family can be enlarged to one of this size (a nice exercise). Thus there are many examples built from the lines of projective planes, weighted voting schemes etc.  Also, any maximal intersecting family can be changed into any other by repeatedly switching a minimal member with its complement.</p>

<p>It is almost true that an intersecting family $\mathcal{F}$ is partition free. If $\left[n\right] \in \mathcal{F}$ (as will be the case for a maximal intersecting family) then we must replace $\left[n\right]$ with $\emptyset$ and then we will have a partition free-set. </p>

<p>There are certainly many other maximal partition-free families: From $\left[ 9 \right]$ start with all the sets with more than half the elements. Replace the whole set by $\emptyset$ and any set of size $6$ which does contain the element $1$ by its complement. </p>

"<p>We first introduce several functions motivated by Kolakoski's sequence. The conjecture itself can be stated independently of Kolakoski's sequence. You can skip straight to the formulation of the conjecture below the line. Kolakoski's sequence is the unique sequence of 1's and 2's which describes its own sequence of block lengths and whose first term is 1. The first few terms are 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1.... </p>

<p>Notation: we'll write sequences as strings. We use a sequence of length 1 and a single term interchangeably. The concatenation of sequences $s$ and $t$ is $st.$</p>

<p>Let $m, n$ be different positive integers. $\{m, n\}^\omega$ is the set of finite nonempty sequences whose terms are all $m$ or $n.$ We define $E_{m, n}: \{m, n\}^\omega \times \{m, n\}^\omega \rightarrow \{m, n\}^\omega$ recursively as follows. </p>

<p>If $t$ has length $1$, then $E_{m, n}(s, t)$ is the unique finite sequence whose terms are all $m$ or $n$, whose first term is the term in $t$, and whose sequence of block lengths is $s.$ For example, $E_{2, 3}(233, 2)=22333222.$</p>

<p>If $t$ has length greater than $1,$ then suppose that $t=yu,$ where $y$ is a single term (the first term), $u$ is the rest of the sequence, and $yu$ is the concatenation. Then $E_{m, n}(s, yu) = E_{m, n}(E_{m, n}(s, y), u).$</p>

<p>One can show that for finite sequences $s_1, s_2, t_1,$ there exists a unique sequence $t_2$ of the same length as $t_1$ (all in $\{m, n\}^\omega$) such that $E_{m, n}(s_1s_2, t_1) = E_{m, n}(s_1, t_1)E_{m, n}(s_2, t_2).$ Furthermore, $t_2$ depends only on $s_1, t_1.$ We define the function $C_{m, n}$ such that $C_{m, n}(s_1, t_1) = t_2.$</p>

<hr>

<p>Another way to define $C_{m, n}: \{m, n\} \times \{m, n\}^\omega \rightarrow \{m, n\}^\omega$, where $m, n$ are positive integers.</p>

<p>We've restricted the first argument to $\{m, n\}$ because that's all that's necessary for the conjecture. Aside: in general, it makes sense for the first argument to be a finite sequence. See the above paragraph. One can show that $C_{m, n}(s_1 s_2, t_1) = C_{m, n}(s_2,C_{m, n}(s_1, t_1)).$</p>

<p>For $x, t$ in $\{m, n\},$ we define $C_{m, n}(x, t)$ to be $\bar{t},$ where $\bar{t}$ is the value in $\{m, n\}$ not equal to $t.$</p>

<p>For $x, y$ in $\{m, n\}$ and $u$ in $\{m, n\}^\omega,$ we define $f(s):=C_{m, n}(y, s)$ and $C_{m, n}(x, yu):=\bar{y}f^x(u),$ where the superscript denotes iteration. </p>

<p>For example, $C_{1, 2}(1, 222) = 1 C_{1, 2}(2, 22) = 11\left(C_{1, 2}(2, C_{1, 2}(2, 2)) \right) = 112.$</p>

<p>Some more examples: $C_{1, 2}(1, -)$ sends $111, 112, 121, 122, 211, 212, 221, 222$ to $222, 221, 212, 211, 121, 122, 111, 112$ respectively, and $C_{1, 2}(2, -)$ sends $111, 112, 121, 122, 211, 212, 221, 222$ to $211, 212, 221, 222, 111, 112, 121, 122$ respectively.</p>

<p>Observe that $C_{m, n}(x, -),$ where $x$ is fixed, is bijective on $\{m, n\}^\omega,$ and it fixes lengths. Here is the conjecture:</p>

<p><strong>Conjecture.</strong> Let $n, j$ be positive integers with $n$ even. Let $1^j$ be the sequence of $j$ terms which are all $1.$ Then the size of the orbit of $1^j$ under the function $C_{m, n}(1, -)$ equals $2^{\lfloor(j+1)/2\rfloor}.$</p>

<p>One can show that the following conjecture is equivalent: Let $n, j$ be positive integers with $n$ with $j$ even. Then the sequence $E_{1, n}(1^{2^j}, 1^{2j})$ has odd length. $(*)$</p>

<p>We can also define $C_{m, n}: \{m, n\} \times \{m, n\}^\omega \rightarrow \{m, n\}^\omega$ where $m, n$ are any integers. Well, we define it exactly as above. A negative power means involves taking the inverse of the function. To do this, we need the functions $C_{m, n}(x, -)$ to be bijective and length preserving. These properties are easy to show.</p>

<p>Here is another conjecture.</p>

<p><strong>Conjecture.</strong> Let $n, j$ be positive integers with $n$ even. Let $s_1, s_2$ be the two sequences of length $j$ which terms alternate between $-1$ and $n.$ Then the size of the orbits of $s_1$ and $s_2$ under the function $C_{-1, n}(-1,-)$ both equal $2^{\lfloor (j+1)/2 \rfloor}.$</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Empirical evidence:</strong> Using C++ and a fast routine to exponentiate maps as well as some elementary observations, I proved both conjectures for all $j \le 26$ and all even integers $n.$ Using the equivalent form $(*),$ I proved the conjecture for the cases $n=2$ and $j \le 46.$</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> One can easily show that the sizes of the orbit of an arbitrary string of length $j$ under the function $C_{m, n}(s, -)$ for an arbitrary string $s$ is at most $2^{\lfloor(j+1)/2\rfloor}.$ Thus the sizes of the orbits which we've stated are in some sense the maximum possible.</p>

<p>Note that this conjecture is not true when replacing the strings $1^j, s_1, s_2$ with arbitrary strings. For arbitrary strings, I've empirically found that the lengths of strings related to $E_{1, n}(1^{2^j}, 1^{2j})$ seem to be randomly even or odd, whereas they are always odd for the cases in the conjecture. Because I don't understand this conjecture well, it sort of looks like there are several hundred coin flips landing the same way. I also suspect that understanding these conjectures will involve fields outside combinatorics, but I have no idea which.</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware, this was first observed by Yongyi Chen. I would be interested if this conjecture is actually known.</p>

<p>For $k=2$ this means simply 
that the existence of an edge from $v$ to $w$ forbids the existence of an edge from $w$ to $v$ and one can thus choose arbitrary orientions (giving rise to a graph in $C$) on the edges of the complete unoriented graph. </p>

<p>This group is trivial for $n=2,3$ and infinite for $n\geq 4$. Given a directed graph,
one can consider the corresponding group-presentation with generators corresponding to vertices and directed edges corresponding to relations $a^{-1}ba=b^2$. The triviality 
of the group constructed by Higman associated to $n=2,3$ implies that we want to avoid 
oriented cycles of length $\leq 3$ when searching for interesting examples.</p>

<p>Let $S_n$ be the symmetric group. Recall that the number of inversions of a permutation $\sigma\in S_n$ is the number of ordered pairs $i&lt; j$ with $\sigma(i) &gt; \sigma(j)$. Now, call the number of permutations with $k$-inversions $I_n(k)$. It's easy to see that going from $n-1$ to $n$ we can insert $n$ into spot $j$ to add $n-j$ inversions:</p>

<p>$$I_n(k)=I_{n-1}(k)+I_{n-1}(k-1)+\ldots +I_{n-1}(0).$$</p>

<p>If we let $G_n(t)=\sum_{k=0}^{\binom{n}{2}}I_n(k)t^k$, then the above gives 
$$G_n(t)=(1+t+t^2\ldots+t^{n-1})G_{n-1}(t),$$ </p>

<p>and it quickly follows that $G_n(t)=\prod_{j=1}^n\frac{1-x^j}{1-x}$. </p>

<p>I am interested in something more complicated. Let $I^{\sigma(y)=x}_n(k)$ count the number of permutations $\sigma$ of length $n$ such that for a given (fixed) $x,y$ we have $\sigma(y)=x$. In other words I am forcing $y$ to be in bin $x$. Proceeding by similar lines to the above, I get:</p>

<p>$$I_{n}^{\sigma(y)=x}(k)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1-y}I_{n-1}^{\sigma(y)=x}(k-i)+\sum_{i=n-y+1}^nI^{\sigma(y-1)=x}_{n-1}(k-i)$$</p>

<p>where similar logic was used as before, except now we have to be careful whether we are inserting $n$ to the right/left respectively (inserting to the left shifts $x$ up one bin).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assuming the above is right, is it at all tractable to derive
  an <em>asymptotic formula</em> for $I_n^{\sigma(y)=x}(k)$, as $n\rightarrow\infty$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I understand, the way to derive asymptotics for $I_n(k)$, one needs something akin to the Knuth-Netto Formula:</p>

<p>$$I_{n}(k)=\binom{n+k-1}{k}+\sum_{j=1}^\infty (-1)^j\binom{n+k-u_j-j-1}{k-u_j-j}+\sum_{j=1}^\infty(-1)^j\binom{n+k-u_j-1}{k-u_j},$$</p>

<p>where the $u_j=3(3j-1)/2$ are pentagonal numbers. The above can be ""simplified"" using Stirling's approximation and a bunch of careful arithmetic to give asymptotics. <a href=""http://academic.csuohio.edu/bmargolius/homepage/inversions/invers.htm#s5"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is a reference for such a calculation.</a></p>

<p>Naively, the above formula comes from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">Euler pentagonal number theorem</a>. I would think one needs a specialized form of this theorem for what I am interested in.</p>

"<p>Given a prime power $q$, I would like to enumerate (preferably up to isomorphism*) all the permutation polynomials $f(x)$ on $K = GF(q^3)$ satisfying the following conditions:</p>

<li>$f(ax) = af(x)$ for all $a \in GF(q)$,</li>
<li>$Tr_{K/F}(x f(x)) = 0$. ($F := GF(q)$)</li>
</ol>

<p>Such polynomials correspond to perfect matchings in the incidence graph of the projective plane $PG(2,q)$ as follows:
Look at $GF(q^3)$ as a $3$-dimensional vector space over $GF(q)$ equipped with the symmetric bilinear form $(x,y) \mapsto Tr_{K/F}(xy)$. Let the points of the projective plane be $1$-dimensional subspaces. 
And let the lines be given by the $2$-dimensional null spaces of the maps $x \mapsto Tr(ax)$, i.e. $a^\perp$, for a given $a \in GF(q^3)$. 
Therefore, a point $p$ is incident with a line $L$ if $Tr(x_p x_L) = 0$ where $x_p$ and $x_L$ are corresponding members of $GF(q^3)$. 
Now, every permutation polynomial on $GF(q^3)$ defined by the two conditions above maps $1$-dimensional subspaces to $1$-dimensional subspaces giving rise to a bijection between points and lines of $PG(2,q)$, i.e., a perfect matching in the incidence graph of $PG(2,q)$. 
We can see that this is an onto map where fiber of each perfect matching is a set of $(q-1)^{1+q+q^2}$ permutation polynomials. </p>

<p>By [1] a $k$-regular bipartite graph of size $2n$ has at least $$\left( \frac{(k-1)^{(k-1)}}{k^{(k-2)}} \right)^n$$ perfect matchings. 
Therefore there is a lower bound on the number of perfect matchings given by 
$\frac{q^{qn}}{(q+1)^{n(q-1)}}$ where $n = 1 + q + q^2$. </p>

<p>I also know that for for $q = 3$ there are exactly $3852$ perfect matchings giving rise to $31555584 = 3852 \times 2^{13}$ such permutations. This is from computer computations of the perfect matchings. For $q = 4$ there are $18534400$ of them. </p>

For a permutation polynomial $f$ and a group element $\sigma$ define $f^\sigma (x) = \hat{\sigma} (f(\sigma(x))$ where $\hat{\sigma}$ is the adjoint of $\sigma$ w.r.t. the symmetric bilinear form $(x, y) \mapsto Tr_{K/F}(xy)$.</p>

<p>L[n] := sum{k=0..n} F[n,k],</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>F[n,k] := (2n+1)!! / [(2k+1) k! (n-k)!].</p>

<p>Step 1. Type it into Maple.  In this case, Maple reports back</p>

<p>L[n] = ( (2n+1) (2n choose n) / 2^n ) hypergeom([1/2, -n], [3/2], -1).</p>

<p>I don't know exactly what this hypergeom is, nor how to evaluate its asymptotics.  I can't seem to get Maple to tell me (with asympt()) either.</p>

<p>Step 2. Evaluate the first few terms (1, 4, 14, 48, 166, 584, 2092, etc.) and type it into OEIS.  It's clearly sequence A082590.  There are many definitions given for this sequence; One definition is (basically) the above hypergeometric formula.  Another is that it is</p>

<p>2^n sum{k=0..n} 2^(-k) (2k choose k).</p>

"<h2>Terminology and context</h2>

<p>(This should all be standard, but is recalled because terminology sometimes varies, and also to put the question into perspective.)</p>

<p>A partially ordered set is called <strong>well-founded</strong> iff it has no infinite decreasing sequence.  It is called <strong>well-partially-ordered</strong> (=wpo) iff it is well-founded and also has no infinite antichain; equivalently, every linearization (=total order extending the given order) is a well-order; equivalently, the lattice its downsets (=downwards-closed subset, =initial segments), partially ordered by inclusion, is well-founded.</p>

<p>The (well-founded) <strong>rank</strong> of a well-founded partially ordered set $P$ is the ordinal defined inductively by $\mathop{\mathrm{rk}}P = \sup\{\mathop{\mathrm{rk}}(x)+1 : x\in P\}$ where $\mathop{\mathrm{rk}}x = \sup\{\mathop{\mathrm{rk}}(y)+1 : y&lt;x\}$.  This is sometimes also called its “height”.  (Obviously, for a well-order, this is just the order type.)</p>

<p>If $P$ is well-partially-ordered, then the sup of the order types of linearizations is attained (de Jongh and Parikh, “<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1385725877900671"">Well-Partial Orderings and Hierarchies</a>”, <em>Nederl. Akad. Wetensch. Proc. Ser. A</em> <strong>80</strong> = <em>Indag. Math.</em> <strong>39</strong> (1977), 195–207, thm. 2.13).  Furthermore, the sup in question is also the well-founded rank of the set of proper downsets, partially ordered by inclusion (a fact surprisingly difficult to find in the literature: see Blass &amp; Gurevich, “<a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1352586"">Program Termination and Well Partial Orderings</a>”, <em>ACM Trans. Comput. Log.</em> <strong>9</strong> (2008), art. 18, §4.1 and §7).  Let this ordinal $o(P)$ be called the <strong>type</strong> or “length” or “stature” (comments about which term is best are welcome, incidentally).</p>

<p>Clearly, $\mathop{\mathrm{rk}} P \leq o(P)$ (with equality when $P$ is, in fact, totally ordered, i.e., well-ordered).  Also note for example that if $P = \Sigma^*$ is the set of words on a finite alphabet $\Sigma$, partially ordered by the “subword” relation, then $o(\Sigma^*) = \omega^{\omega^{n-1}}$ where $n = \#\Sigma$ (see <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/237188/computing-the-ordinal-of-a-rational-language-well-partially-ordered-by-the-subwo"">this other question</a>), whereas $\mathop{\mathrm{rk}}(\Sigma^*) = \omega$.</p>

Given an $n \times n$ matrix $A = (a_{ij})$, where $a_{ij} = \pm 1$, we want to maximise the quantity</p>

<p>$x^T A y = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} x_i y_j$</p>

<p>over all $n$-dimensional vectors $x$, $y$ such that $x_i,y_j = \pm 1$. The name of the problem comes from interpreting $A$ as a grid of lights that are on or off, and $x$ and $y$ as sets of light switches, each associated with a row or column (respectively); flipping a switch flips all lights in that row or column, and the goal is to maximise the number of lights switched on.</p>

<p>Let $m(A)$ be the maximum of $x^T A y$ over $x$ and $y$ such that $x_i,y_j = \pm 1$. As Alon and Spencer discuss, for any $A$ it is possible to show that $m(A) \ge C n^{3/2}$ for some constant $0&lt;C&lt;1$. On the other hand, there is an explicit family of matrices $A$ such that $m(A) = n^{3/2}$.</p>

<p>It is natural to generalise this problem to $n \times n \times \dots \times n$ arrays $A$ containing $\pm 1$ entries, writing</p>

<p>$A(x^1,\dots,x^d) := \sum_{i_1,\dots,i_d=1}^n a_{i_1\dots i_d} x^1_{i_1} x^2_{i_2} \dots x^d_{i_d}$</p>

<p>and defining $m(A)$ as the maximum of $A(x^1,\dots,x^d)$ over $x^1,\dots,x^d$, each of which is again an $n$-dimensional vector of $\pm 1$'s. Now it is known (and fun to prove!) that for this ""$d$-dimensional"" variant, one can always achieve $m(A) \ge C^d n^{(d+1)/2}$ for some universal constant $C$ between 0 and 1, and on the other hand there exists a family of $A$'s with $m(A) = n^{(d+1)/2}$.</p>

<p><b>My question is:</b> can the lower bound be improved to $m(A) \ge C n^{(d+1)/2}$ for some universal constant $C&gt;0$? Or even just improved so that the dependence on $d$ is subexponential? Conversely, can the upper bound be reduced?</p>

<p><b>Background</b></p>

<p>The following question of Horst Knörrer is a sort of toy problem coming from mathematical physics. </p>

<p>Let $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ and $y_1,y_2,\dots, y_n$ be two sets of real numbers.</p>

<p>We give now a weight $\epsilon_\pi$ to every permutation $\pi$ on {1,2,...,n} as follows:</p>

<p>1) $\epsilon_\pi =0$ if for some $k \ge 1$, $x_k \ge y_{\pi(1)}+y_{\pi(2)}+\cdots +y_{\pi(k)}$.</p>

<p>2) Otherwise, $\epsilon_\pi=sg(\pi )$. ($sg (\pi )$ is the sign of the prrmutation $\pi$.)</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Show that there is a constant $C&gt;1$ such that (for every $n$ and every two sequences of reals $x_1,\dots,x_n$ and $y_1, \dots, y_n$), </p>

<p>$$\sum_\pi \epsilon_\pi \le C^n \sqrt{n!}.$$ </p>

<h2>Origin and Motivation from Mathematical Physics</h2>

<p>1) The problem was proposed by Horst in a recent Oberwolfach's meeting as a combinatorial problem that arises (as a toy problem) from mathematical physics. </p>

<p>The context of this question is explained in Section 4 of 
J.Feldman, H.Kn\""orrer, E.Trubowitz:
""<a href=""http://www.math.ethz.ch/~knoerrer/feldknoerrer.pdf"">Construction of a 2-d Fermi Liquid</a>"", Proc. XIV. International Congress on Mathematical Physics. Editor: Jean Claude Zambrini. World Scientific 2005</p>

<p>""In this section, we formulate an elementary question about permutations that may be connected with implementing the Pauli exclusion principle in momentum space."" </p>

<p>The problem and some variations are directly related to ""cancellations between
Fermionic diagrams"".</p>

<p>The wider picture (See the <a href=""http://www.math.ubc.ca/~feldman/fl.html"">Eleven Papers by J.Feldman, H.Knörrer, E.Trubowitz</a>) is toward mathematical understanding and formalism for highly successful physics quantum theories. (In a very very wide sense this is related to Clay's problem on <a href=""http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Yang-Mills_Theory/"">Yang-Mills and Mass gap</a>.) </p>

<h2>Remarks and more Motivation</h2>

<p>2) This remarkable cancellation property seems similar to cancellations that we often encounter in probability theory, combinatorics and number theory. </p>

<p>3) It look similar to me even to issues that came in my <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/57543/walsh-fourier-transform-of-the-mobius-function"">recent question</a> on Walsh functions.
So this question about permutations is analogous to questions asserting that for certain +1,-1,0 functions on ${-1,1}^n$ there is a remarkable cancellation when you sum over all $\pm 1$ vectors. This is true (to much extent) for very ""low complexity class functions"" (functions in $AC^0$) by a theorem of Linial-Mansour-Nisan, So maybe we can expect remarkable cancellation for ""not too complex"" functions defined on the set of permutations.</p>

<p>4) We can simplify in the question and replace condition 1) by </p>

<p>1') $\epsilon_\pi =0$ if for some $k \ge 1$, $x_k \ge y_{\pi(k)}$. </p>

<p>I don't know if this makes much difference.</p>

<p>5) An affarmative answer seems a very bold statement, so, of course, perhaps the more promising direction is to find a counter example. But I think this may be useful too.</p>

"<p>I have the following problem </p>

<p>consider a random bipartite with vertex classes $A$ and $B$ of size $|A|=|B|=\mathrm{log}^{2}(n)$ graph in which every possible edge is chosen independently with probability $p(n)=\frac{1}{{\mathrm{log} (n)}}$. Now i don't know if this graph will contain w.h.p a perfect matching but if it does i'd like to prove it. So i guess my first question is does it? If the answer to my first question is yes, id' like to be able to prove it. As i'm fairly new to perfect matchings i had the following idea, although i'm not sure if this is a conventional way to prove a random bipartite graph has a perfect matching w.h.p </p>

<p>I'm aware that Halls condition is a necessary and sufficient condition to prove the existence of a perfect matching i.e. for any subset $S \subseteq A$ that $|N(S)| \geq |S|$. So would it suffice to show that for any $S \subseteq A$ that $|N(S)| \geq |S|$ in the following way. If a set $S'$ violates Halls condition then there must exist at least $\mathrm{log}^{2}(n)-|S'|$ vertices in $B$ which are not adjacent to any vertex in $S'$. Given any collection of these vertices the probability they are not independent to any vertex in $S'$ is $(1-p)^{|S'|(\mathrm{log}^{2}(n)-|S'|)}$. In addition there are $\binom{\mathrm{log}^{2}(n)}{\mathrm{log}^{2}(n)-|S'|}$ possible choices for $|S'|$  and $|S'|$ can range from $1$ to $\mathrm{log}^{2}(n)$. Henceit would suffice to require $\sum_{|S'|=1}^{\mathrm{log}^{2}(n)} \binom{\mathrm{log}^{2}(n)}{\mathrm{log}^{2}(n)-|S'|}(1-p)^{|S'|(\mathrm{log}^{2}(n)-|S'|)}=o(1).$ where $p=\frac{1}{\mathrm{log}(n)}$.</p>

<p><em>Background.</em>
This inequality is due to <a href=""http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=184950"">Blakley and Roy (1965)</a>. In fact, they proved even more, namely when the LHS corresponds to a path of length $k$ (above $k=3$) and the RHS is $(\int f)^k$. </p>

The general case of Sidorenko's conjecture is still open. See, e.g., this <a href=""http://math.mit.edu/~fox/paper-sidorenko-short.pdf"">note by Conlon, Fox, and Sudakov</a> (although there has been some other progress since then).</p>

<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1153v1"">Szegedy and Li</a> gives a different proof of the above inequality, using convexity of the logarithm function. </p>

"<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I came up with this while trying to find a sort of high-level exposition of the exterior algebra of a vector space.  Let $V$ be a vector space of dimension $n$ over $\mathbb{C}$, and let $k \in \mathbb{N}$.  One picture of $\Lambda^k(V)$, the $k^{th}$ exterior power of $V$, is as the space of totally antisymmetric tensors in $V^{\otimes k}$.</p>

<p>This can be constructed as follows.  Let
$$ \rho : S_k \to \mathrm{End}(V^{\otimes k})$$
be the representation given by
$$ \rho_\pi (v_1 \otimes \dots \otimes v_k) = v_{\pi(1)} \otimes \dots \otimes v_{\pi(k)},$$
and then let $\sigma$ be the alternating form of this representation, i.e. $\sigma_\pi = sgn(\pi) \rho_\pi$.  The total antisymmetrizer is the map
$$A_k = \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{\pi \in S_k} \sigma_\pi.$$
This is the projection onto the space of totally antisymmetric tensors, and so we can calculate the dimension of $\Lambda^k(V)$ simply by taking the trace of the map $A_k$.  It turns out that 
$$\mathrm{tr}(\rho_\pi) = n^{cyc(\pi)},$$
where by $cyc(\pi)$ I mean the number of cycles in the factorization of $\pi$ into disjoint cycles (including cycles of length 1).  This can be shown as follows.  Take a basis $\{ e_1, \dots, e_n \}$ of $V$ and then form the basis for $V^{\otimes k}$ consisting of all vectors $ e_{i_1} \otimes \dots \otimes e_{i_k}$ such that $1 \le i_1, \dots, i_k \le n $.  Then 
$$ \rho_\pi(e_{i_1} \otimes \dots \otimes e_{i_k}) = e_{i_{\pi(1)}} \otimes \dots \otimes e_{i_{\pi(k)}},$$
so this basis vector contributes 1 to the trace of $\rho_\pi$ if and only if $i_j = i_{\pi(j)}$ for all $1 \le j \le k$, i.e. if and only if all labels are constant over cycles of $\pi$.  Since there are $n$ choices for each label, this gives
$$\mathrm{tr}(\rho_\pi) = n^{cyc (\pi)},$$
and thus
$$ \mathrm{tr}(A_k) = \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{\pi \in S_k} sgn(\pi) n^{cyc (\pi)}.$$</p>

"<p>Many chess positions that one may easily set up on a chess board
are impossible to achieve in a game of legal moves. For example,
among the impossible situations would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>A position in which both kings are in check.</li>
<li>A position in which there are pawns on the first or on the
last rank.</li>
<li>A position with two white pawns on the same file, but black

<li>A position with a white bishop on the first rank, trapped by two
white pawns on the second rank, but the bishop is not on c1 or f1.</li>
<li>A position with two black-square white bishops and eight white pawns.</li>

containing many interesting chess detective stories, some
involving positions that were impossible for sometimes very subtle
reasons.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p><strong>Question.</strong> What proportion of the chess positions that one can
set up on the board, using a legal collection of chess pieces, can
actually arise in a legal chess game?</p>

<p>What I mean is that collection of pieces is <em>legal</em>, if it occurs
in a position of a legal chess game, a game played according to
the rules. This collection is somewhat broader than one might
naively expect, since it is legally possible, for example, to have
a king of each color with nine white queens, as white may have
promoted all the pawns while all other pieces were captured. And
other similarly strange collections of pieces are possible. So the
collection of positions I am considering are those that can be
obtained by messing up the pieces on the board from an actual
legal game.</p>

<p>Of course it will be too difficult to get an exact answer, and I
shall be satisfied merely with good bounds. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess#Mathematics_and_computers"">Wikipedia page on
chess and mathematics</a> mentions some numbers, including estimates on the
number of legal positions, but the information there doesn't seem
to answer this question. Perhaps those who are more familiar with
that work can point to where this question is answered there.</p>

<p>I guess the answer must be a rather small proportion, because it
seems that many legal chess positions can be easily transformed
into many illegal ones, by placing both kings in check, by adding
a pawn to the first rank (unless all pawns are already used), etc.
Is this right, and can such an argument be used to make tight
bounds?</p>

<p>I am here at the <a href=""http://www.chesscamp.net/camps/overnight_camp.htm"">Mountain Lake Chess Camp</a>, where we've been
discussing the question, when one of the instructors mentioned the
numerical bounds on the total number of chess positions, and the

"<p>[Metastuff: I asked this question in a slightly different way on mathSE last week, and it didn't go anywhere, which is why I am asking here. I added the DST tag because it's basically a problem about Borel equivalence relations stripped of all the Borelness constraints. I do need help, so helpful redirection is appreciated.]</p>

<p>I am trying to give a somewhat constructive definition of a function. It's somewhat constructive because I'll freely assume that I can well-order any set. Aside from that, I want to say what the function looks like.</p>

<p>I have two equivalence relations $E$ and $F$ on spaces $X$ and $Y$, respectively. There are no restrictions on the sizes of anything. I want to define a function $f : X \to Y$ such that
$$ x E y \Leftrightarrow f(x) F f(y)\;\;\;\text{ and }\;\;\;f(x) = f(y) \Rightarrow x = y $$
for all $x,y \in X$. This makes $f$ send all points in an $E$-class to the same $F$-class and also be injective on equivalence classes (i.e., injective as $X/E \to Y/F$) and on the underlying space.</p>

<p>Let $I$ be the class of nonzero cardinals. For every $i \in I$, the number of $F$-classes of size at least $i$ is greater than or equal to the number of $E$-classes of size at least $i$. I want to give a mostly-constructive proof that this is sufficient for there to be a function as described above (from $E$ to $F$), i.e., I want to describe the function.</p>

<p>I have been struggling with this on and off for several weeks. Below are some possible time-savers for you guys. If you already have a solution, you can skip it.</p>

<hr>

<p>The problem is extremely easy in the slightly nicer situation where, for every $i \in I$, the number of $F$-classes of size <strong>exactly</strong> $i$ is greater than or equal to the number of $E$-classes of size <strong>exactly</strong> $i$. Just partition the set of $E$-classes by size and put a well-order on each set in the partition. Do the same for $F$-classes. Then send the $n$th $E$-class of size $i$ to the $n$th $F$-class of size $i$.</p>

<p>The complication for the original case is that you might have to send an $E$-class of size $i$ to an $F$-class of size $j$ with $i &lt; j$. Two problems arise this way.</p>

<p>First, you can't use the larger classes wastefully by sending relatively small classes to them. E.g., if $E$ has solely two classes, one of size $2$ and one of size $5$, and $F$ has solely two classes, one of size $4$ and one of size $6$, you cannot send the class of size $2$ to the class of size $6$. The only way that I can think to avoid this problem is inductively: (i) well-order the classes in some way, (ii) send the least $E$-class to the least $F$-class that is big enough, (iii) remove these, and (iv) repeat from step (ii).</p>

<p>This creates the second problem: how to choose the well-order for step (i). If you try, e.g., to order the classes by increasing size with an arbitrary order among classes of the same size, you run into the following problem (as Brian Scott pointed out to me on mathSE a week ago). Suppose $E$ has $\omega$ many classes of size $1$ and one class of size $2$. Suppose $F$ has one class each of every finite size. Then the above won't work because $F$ has order-type $\omega$, but $E$ has order-type $\omega+1$.</p>

<p>You can fix this case with the same trick that you use to well-order the rationals. Put the $E$-classes of size $i$ into a column and well-order each column. <a href=""http://mathlesstraveled.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/rational-grid-diag-enum.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Then move along the diagonals like so.</a> But it's not clear to me what this looks like when you have any number of columns and rows rather than just countably many. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit to explain potential solution:</strong> It sounds plausible to me that sending an $E$-class to an $F$-class of the smallest available size that is large enough will avoid fatally wasteful assignments regardless of the order in which you make assignments. E.g., given an $E$-class of size $5$, if $F$-classes of sizes $4,7,$ and $9$ are available, choose one of size $7$.</p>

<p>The problem then is just how to iterate through the $E$-classes. This sounds problematic generally, but my knowledge of ordinals is weak. E.g., is there always some sense in which you can iterate through all the members of an initial ordinal?</p>

<p>Put the $E$-classes into <a href=""http://mathlesstraveled.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/rational-grid-diag-enum.png"" rel=""nofollow"">an array like this one</a> so that an $E$-class has an index <strong>(column,row)</strong>. Let the index $(s,p)$ mean that $s$ is the size of the $E$-class and $p$ is its arbitrarily-assigned position in the column. </p>

<p>Consider the case where you have at most countably many $E$-classes of each size and only countably many possible infinite sizes. That is, $p \in \omega$ and $s \in \omega \times \lbrace 0,1\rbrace$. That is, you have countably many finite sizes (tagged with $0$) and countably many infinite sizes (tagged with $1$). Then you just have two copies of the above array; one for finite sizes and one for infinite sizes. </p>

<p>Separately snake through each of them in the way depicted in the linked picture. For the array of finite sizes, this hits indices in this order: $((1,0),1), ((1,0),2), ((2,0),1), ((1,0),3), \ldots$, where the $0$ indicates that you're in the ""finite"" array. For the array of infinite sizes, this hits the indices in this (analogous) order: $((1,1),1), ((1,1),2), ((2,1),1), ((1,1),3), \ldots$. Here, $(1,1)$ denotes some infinite size such as $\omega$; $(2,1)$ might be $2^\omega$, and so on.</p>

<p>Finally, interleave the two orders that you got from snaking through each array. Most simply, you can take one member from each order at a time. This gives:
$$((1,0),1), ((1,1),1), ((1,0),2), ((1,1),2), ((2,0),1), ((2,1),1), ((1,0),3), \ldots$$</p>

<p>I apologize for the somewhat cumbersome notation, but I hope that the pattern becomes clear.</p>

<p>Incidentally, you won't necessarily have an $E$-class for all of the points in the above arrays. E.g., you might not have any $E$-classes of size $2$. I am assuming the fullest possible case for simplicity, as it still defines a well-order when you remove some of the points.</p>

"<p>The following problem came from some joint research with Kevin Ford and Regis de la Breteche.  We believe a confirmation of the question presented at the end of this post will allow us to sharpen our results.</p>

<hr>

<p>We are considering families $F$ of sets which satisfy three properties.  First, each family $F$ is intersecting; that is, for all $A_1, A_2\in F$, we have that $A_1\cap A_2$ is non-empty.  Second, each family is finite, and each set in $F$ is finite as well, with the maximum cardinality of sets $A\in F$ called the size of $F$.  And third, each $F$ satisfies the following minimality condition: if $A\in F$ and $A'$ is a proper, non-empty subset of $A$, then the family of sets $F \cup {A'} \setminus {A}$ is not intersecting.</p>

<p>It can be shown quite quickly that if $F$ has size  $n$, then $|F|\le n^n$.</p>

<p>It is easy to construct a great many such families.  If one has a family $F$ of size $n$ and a set $B=\{ b_1, b_2 , \dots, b_{n+1} \}$ that does not intersect any set of $F$, then one can create a new family $F'$ that contains the set $B$ and new sets of the form $A\cup \{b_i \}$, $1\le i \le n+1$, where each $b_i$ and each set $A$ is part of at least one set of this type.  One can start from the trivial family $F=\{ \{a\}\}$ and build up many ($n$-uniform) families in this way.</p>

<p>By appending each $b_i$ to as few sets as possible, one can obtain families of size $n$ with very few total sets (as few as $n+1$).  By appending each $b_i$ to every set $A\in F$, one can obtain families of size $n$ with cardinality almost that of the maximal order $n^n$</p>

<p>Our question is, in bare form, this: suppose a family of size $n$ is very large, close to the maximal order $n^n$, then must there exist an element or subset that is extremely popular, in the sense that it is contained in many more sets than the average?</p>

<p>Put more concretely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it true that given a family $F$ of size $n$, there exists a set $C$, with $|C|=k$ such that $$\left|\{ A \in  F:  C \subset A  \} \right| \ge \frac{|F|}{n^{o(k)}} $$ as $n \to \infty$?  If so, how good a bound can one obtain?  Would $$\frac{|F|}{100^k}$$ work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our reason for believing this may be true comes from the appending construction mentioned above.  If the appending procedure is applied several times, those elements/subsets belonging to the original $F$ will be very popular in the final family obtained.</p>

"<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>Assume a poset $\langle P, \le \rangle$. For two points $a,b \in P$
with $a \le b$, then $I = [a,b] = \{ x : a \le x \le b \}$ is the
interval between $a$ and $b$.</p>

<p>When $P$ is a chain (e.g. ${\mathbb Z}, {\mathbb R}$), then the $I$
are just standard intervals. Two real intervals $I=[a,b],J=[c,d]
\subseteq {\mathbb R}$ are ordered usually to mean that $I \le J$ iff
$b \le c$. Call this the ""strong order"", which isn't actually a proper
order (it needs to be ""reflexivized"" to require that $I \le I$). Two
other true orders are also available, namely that $a \le c$ and $b \le
d$ (the product order of the endpoints), or that $a \le c$ and $b \ge
d$ (subset order). These last two are conjugate orders. All of these
are defined in the context of Allen's alegbra, enumerating all the
possible relations between $I,J$ given combinations of both equal and
unequal endpoints.</p>

<p>Additionally, the intersection graphs of sets of real intervals are
interval graphs, which are well studied.</p>

<h2>MOTIVATION</h2>

<p>We work with data objects represented as finite, bounded posets.
Analyzing the intervals therein, and their orderings and
intersections, is very useful in a range of applications in layout and
display. </p>

for the concepts of interval order, Allen's algebra, and inteveral
graphs. Our preliminary literature reviews haven't turned up anything,
and we're preparing to start the development from first
principles. Pointers appreciated, thanks!</p>

With the CONSTRAINT that two chips are NOT allowed to be at the same place.
One move - moves  only ONE chip.
ChipK should go to position FinalK - same ""K"".</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong> There can be many approaches to solve the problem, I am interested
in analysis their complexity. Any ideas are welcome. For example if graph is ""random"" in certain sense what can be the algorithm the least average complexity ? </p>

<p>Where complexity is counted in number of operations (write a C-code (I actually wrote a Matlab code), compile to and calculate the number of cycles - this is well-defined complexity measure, different compilers and CPU will give approximately same result). </p>

<p><strong>Example of algorithm</strong> It seems the simplest way to solve a problem is the following.
Essentially it can be reduced to determining where two vertices are connected in some bigger graph, which in turn can be solved by ""breadth-first search"" (""wave algorithm"" in Russian) (I mean let us enumerate all
possible chip configurations - it will give vertices of the ""new graph"". Let us connect two vertices (configurations) if there is a ""MOVE"" which goes form one to another.)

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>The EH conjecture lead to the study of what is called ""packing in a hypergraph."" See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_in_a_hypergraph"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_in_a_hypergraph</a>. Rödl's proof introduced what is now called the ""Rödl nibble"" and is pseudo-random in nature. Spencer gave a lovely proof using branching processes. There are a lot of results from the late 80s to 90s that say, as Kahn puts it in ""Asymptotics of Hypergraph Matching, Covering and Coloring Problems"", that hypergraphs are asymptotically well-behaved <i>as long as their edge sizes are bounded</i>! Unfortunately the $n/2$ version of EH involves hypergraphs of unbounded edge size and the existing methods appear useless.</p>

<h1>Some ideas</h1>

<p>A straightforward application of the method of alterations (or equivalently, some easy analysis of the greedy algorithm) gives that $\kappa_n \leq \log n \frac{1}{\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor} \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} (1 + o(1))$, so the whole question is whether we can eliminate this log factor.</p>

<p>A set of $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$-subsets has maximum coverage of $(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor - 1)$-subsets when all its elements have pairwise symmetric difference of at least 4. So really this is a coding theory problem. The paper ""Lower bounds for constant weight codes"" by Graham and Sloane shows that we can find a set $H$ of $\lfloor n /2\rfloor$-subsets of $[n]$ such that $|H| \geq \frac{1}{2}\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$ and the hamming distance between elements is at least 4. Let $G$ be the set of $(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor - 1)$-subsets covered by $H$. $G$ is half the size we want it to be, but we only used half as many elements are we are allowed. So we might be optimistic that by allowing some small overlap we can cover everything we want.

$l_{1}(x)=l_{1}(y)$ implies $l_{2}(f(x))=l_{2}(f(y))$ for all vertices $x,y$ of $T_{1}$ (where $l_{1}$, $l_{2}$ are the labelling function for $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$, respectively).

That makes the question almost an instance of the graph minor theorem (stating that the finite graphs are wqo under the minor relation) but for the fact that the embeddings must map extra vertices to extra vertices and tree vertices to tree vertices.

<hr>                             

<p>Background: <em>The first part of the following(the column-wise-focus) is also described in Eri Jabotinski's 1953-treatize <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/2032522"" rel=""nofollow"">Representation of functions by matrices (at jstor)</a></em>             </p>

<p>Consider the matrix of Stirling numbers 2nd kind, factorially rescaled in columns and rows; let's call it $S$. I show here only the top left edge; but it is actually meant as of infinite size:     </p>

<p>$\qquad $ <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/2DIy4.png"" alt=""(picture)""></p>

<p>It is well known (see for instance Abramowitz&amp;Stegun) that the generating function for the $c$'th column is $f_c(x)=(\exp(x)-1)^c $ , and for instance the leftmost column (index $c=0$) is related to $f_0(x)=(\exp(x)-1)^0 = 1 $ and the second column (index $c=1$ is related to the well known function $f_1(x)=\exp(x)-1$. So this matrix is also an example for (and in the form of) the (transposed) ""Carleman""-matrices, and in this question I'm interested in a general property of such Carleman-matrices.     </p>

<p>If I extend now that matrix by columns, for which the generating functions are accordingly $f_{-1}(x)=(\exp(x)-1)^{-1} $,$f_{-2}(x)=(\exp(x)-1)^{-2} $ and so on then I have not only to left-prepend new columns but also I must extend the matrix with prepended rows as well. The central segement of this now two-way infinite-indexed matrix, let's call it $S^*$ looks like this          </p>

<p>$ \qquad $ <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/DXhwO.png"" alt=""picture"">              </p>

<p>Well, I'm having that the gf columnwise are $f_c(x)=(\exp(x)-1)^c$ with the column-index now from $-\infty$ to $ \infty$ . Matrices in this two-way-infinite form have been discussed by Eri Jabotinsky but I've not seen a discussion by him of my question so far.       </p>

<p><hr>
Now let's change our view to focus the <strong><em>rows</em></strong> instead.                    </p>

<p>I have found by pattern analyzing, that the rowwise generating functions (in this practical example) are $$g_r(t) = t/(1+t)/\log(1+t)^{r+1} $$ where I have now to replace $t =1/x$ to match the column-index for the exponents at $x$, so actually it is
$$ h_r(x)= 1/(1+x)/\log(1+1/x)^{r+1} $$
The index $r=c=0$ is at the single $1$ in the center of the image, and $r=1$ indicates the row below, which reads, form right to left, $g_1(t)=1 -1/2t+5/12t^2-3/8t^3 ...$   and is also $h_1(x)=1 -1/2/x+5/12/x^2-3/8/x^3 ...$       </p>

<p>I've also checked the similarly extended starred version of the matrix of Stirling numbers 1st kind, whose entries column-wise are generated by the functions $f_c(x)=\log(1+x)^c $.<br>
Here for the row-wise generating functions I've guessed $$g_r(t)= t \exp(t) / (\exp(t)-1)^{r+1} $$ and
$$h_r(x) = g_r(1/x) $$
(Correct me if my guess is wrong here)<br>
The relation of the guessed generating functions of the rows and of the columns is somehow striking, and even might come out simple and possibly trivial.
So my question:              </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Q</em></strong>: Is there any simple/memorizable rule for the relations of generating functions of the transposed Carleman matrices in comparable / general cases?<br>
  <em>(Possibly this applies only to triangular Carlemanmatrices, but I don't know that)</em></p>

<p>Denote by $F_n(\xi)$ the factors of length $n$ of an infinite word $\xi$ and also by $F_n^{\infty}(\xi)$ the factors of length $n$ that occur infinitely often. Define two equivalence relations on words:
$$
 \xi \sim_k \eta \mbox{ iff } \xi[1\ldots k] = \eta[1\ldots k] \land F_k(\xi) = F_k(\eta)

their prefix and factors of length $k$ coincide, what is the size of the minimal automata separating them, and 2) if for two infinite words $\xi \sim_k^{\infty} \eta$, what is the minimum size of an automata separating them?</p>

<p>For i) I believe there is no interesting relationship, cause consider $\xi_i = 0^i 1 0^{\omega}$ and $\eta_i = (0^i1)^{\omega}$ then $\xi_i \sim_i \eta_i$ for all $i$ and they could always be separated by a two-state automata which stays in the first state as long as it read $0$'s, switches to the second state on the first $1$, and then stays there as long as just $0$'s are read, so accepting $\xi_i$ but not $\eta_i$. This lead me to consider the second equivalence relation. Here for example $\eta_i = (0^i1)^{\omega}$ and $\xi_i = 0^i100^i1000^i1\ldots$, then $\xi_i \sim^{\infty}_i \eta$ and I guess the minimal automata needed to separate them has $i+2$ states, reading $0$'s in the first state, switch to second state on first $1$, and then a loop which counts the $0$'s (need $i$ states for the loop) and goes back to the second state if $i$ $0$'s are followed by a $1$, so passing the second state an infinite number of times. This automata accepts $\eta_i$ but not $\xi_i$. </p>

I'm not aware of any efficient algorithms that solve this problem directly, so I am trying to think of a way to transform the problem so that it can be passed to standard max-flow algorithms that assume all arc capacities are non-negative.</p>

<p>The only hint I could find online was a question in a 1999 homework assignment which asks students to ""Show how to reduce the problem of maximum flow with possibly negative capacities to two maximum flow problems both with nonnegative capacities.""

<p>How can this be done?</p>

<p>Edit #1:  I should explain the origin of these ((u,v),(v,u)) pairs. What I am really trying to do is solve an s-t maximum flow in a graph that is essentially undirected. By ""essentially undirected"" I mean a graph that is undirected except for arcs with source s and target in the undirected graph, and arcs with source in the undirected graph and target t. Of course, this kind of ""partially directed"" graph must be translated into a normal directed graph for any s-t max flow algorithm. To do this, I am applying the standard transformation of replacing every undirected edge (u&lt;->v) (with weight c) with a pair of directed arcs (u->v) and (v->u) with weight c. Since the original graph sometimes has negative edge weights, these ((u,v),(v,u)) pairs with equal negative weights arise.</p>

$N/2 &lt; p &lt; 2N/3$ divide $S_N$ with multiplicity one. So here is my question:</p>

<p>Q: How would you show that there exists at least one prime $p$ in the interval $N/2 &lt; p &lt; 2N/3$ that divides exactly $S_N$, i.e., $p|S_N$ but $p^2\nmid S_N$ ,?</p>

"<p>Given a connected graph $G$, two players, Blue and Green, play the following game: initially, all vertices are unclaimed.  Players alternate turns.  On her turn, Blue adds a token to either an unclaimed vertex (turning it blue) or a blue vertex, and similarly on his turn, Green adds a token to either an unclaimed vertex (turning it green) or a green vertex.</p>

<p>If a vertex of degree $d$ ever receives $d$ tokens, it <em>topples</em>, donating one token to each of its neighbors.  This may in turn cause some of its neighbors to topple, and so on, as in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bak%E2%80%93Tang%E2%80%93Wiesenfeld_sandpile"">sandpile model</a>.  If Blue sets off a sequence of one or more topplings, she colors blue every vertex on which a token landed as a consequence of her move, and likewise for Green.  (Note that because the sandpile model is abelian, we don't need to specify an order of topplings.)  A player wins when she has managed to color the entire graph in her color.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>: For which graphs $G$ is this game a first-player win?</p>

<p>I would be interested in any nontrivial statements for interesting classes of graphs, e.g., for paths, trees, cycles, complete bipartite graphs, grid graphs, whatever.  The game is trivially a first-player win on a complete graph $K_n$: the first player simply plays $n - 1$ times on the same vertex, and there is nothing the second player can do.  It's also not hard to see that it's a second-player win on the graph with two edges and three vertices: the first player cannot win on her move, and following her move there is always one token on the degree-2 vertex.  The second player places a token on the unclaimed leaf vertex, which topples; there are now two tokens on the degree-2 vertex, which topples, making player 2 the winner.</p>

<p><em>Motivation</em>: This came up not in my research but rather in my relaxation -- there's a game installed on my math department Linux distribution called <a href=""http://www.kde.org/applications/games/kjumpingcube"">KJumpingCube</a>, which is precisely this game on square grid graphs.</p>

"<p>I am trying to derive the <a href=""http://alexandria.tue.nl/repository/freearticles/597601.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">classic paper</a> in the title only by elementary means (no generating functions, no complex analysis, no Fourier analysis) although with much less precision. In short, I ""only"" want to prove that the average height $h_n$ of a tree with $n$ nodes (that is, the maximum number of nodes from the root to a leaf) satisfies $h_n \sim \sqrt{\pi n}$.</p>

<p>The outline is as follows. Let $A_{nh}$ be the number of trees with height less than or equal to $h$ (with the convention $A_{nh} = A_{nn}$ for all $h \geqslant n$) and $B_{nh}$ the number of trees of $n$ nodes with height greater than or equal to $h+1$ (that is, $B_{nh} = A_{nn} - A_{nh}$). Then $h_n = S_n/A_{nn}$, where $S_n$ is the finite sum
$$
S_n = \sum_{h \geqslant 1} h(A_{nh} - A_{n,h-1}) = \sum_{h \geqslant 1} h(B_{n,h-1} - B_{nh}) = \sum_{h \geqslant 0} B_{nh}.
$$
It is well known that $A_{nn} = \frac{1}{n}\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$, for the set of general trees with $n$ nodes is in bijection with the set of binary trees with $n-1$ nodes, counted by the Catalan numbers.</p>

<p>Therefore, the first step is to find $B_{nh}$ and then the main term in the asymptotic expansion of $S_n$.</p>

<p>At this point the authors use analytical combinatorics (three pages) to derive
$$
B_{n+1,h-1} = \sum_{k \geqslant 1} \left[\binom{2n}{n+1-kh} - 2\binom{2n}{n-kh} + \binom{2n}{n-1-kh}\right].
$$</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My own attempt is as follows. I consider the bijection between trees with $n$ nodes
  and monotonic paths on a square grid $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ from $(0,0)$ to $(n-1,n-1)$ which do not cross the diagonal (and are made of two kinds of steps: $\uparrow$ and $\rightarrow$). These paths are sometimes called <em>Dyck paths</em> or <em>excursions</em>. I can express now $B_{nh}$ in terms of lattice paths: it is the number of Dyck paths of length 2(n-1) and height greater than or equal to $h$. (Note: a tree of height $h$ is in bijection with a Dyck path of height $h-1$.)</p>
  
  <p>Without loss of generality, I assume that they start with $\uparrow$ (hence stay above the diagonal). For each path, I consider the first step crossing the line $y = x + h - 1$, if any. From the point above, all the way back to the origin, I change $\uparrow$ into $\rightarrow$ and vice versa (this is a <em>reflection</em> wrt the line $y=x+h$). It becomes apparent that the paths I want to count ($B_{nh}$) are in bijection with the monotonic paths from $(-h,h)$ to $(n-1,n-1)$ which avoid the boundaries $y=x+2h+1$ and $y=x-1$. (See <a href=""http://www.filedropper.com/lattice"" rel=""nofollow"">figure</a>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the classic book <em>Lattice Path Counting and Applications</em> by Mohanty (1979, page 6) the formula
$$
\sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} \left[\binom{m+n}{m-k(t+s)} - \binom{m+n}{n+k(t+s)+t}\right],
$$
counts the number of monotonic paths in a lattice from $(0,0)$ to $(m,n)$, which avoid the boundaries $y = x - t$ and $y = x + s$, with $t &gt; 0$ and $s &gt; 0$. (This result was first established by Russian statisticians in the 50s.) Therefore, by considering a new origin at $(-h,h)$, we satisfy the conditions of the formula: $s=1$, $t=2h+1$ and the destination point (the upper right corner) is now $(n+h-1,n-h-1)$. Then
$$
B_{nh} = \sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} \left[\binom{2n-2}{n+h-1-k(2h+2)} - \binom{2n-2}{n-h-1+k(2h+2) + 2h+1}\right].
$$
This can be simplified in
$$
B_{n+1,h-1} = \sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} \left[\binom{2n}{n+1-(2k+1)h} - \binom{2n}{n-(2k+1)h}\right],
$$
which, in turn, is equivalent to
$$
B_{n+1,h-1} = \sum_{k \geqslant 0} \left[\binom{2n}{n+1-(2k+1)h} - 2\binom{2n}{n-(2k+1)h} + \binom{2n}{n-1-(2k+1)h}\right].
$$
The difference with the expected formula is that I sum over the odd numbers ($2k+1$), instead of all positive integers ($k$). First, I hoped that the even terms would cancel out, but that does not seem to be the case.</p>

<p>Any idea where is the problem?</p>

<p>[<strong>Edit:</strong>
Starting from the expected result, by the same elementary binomial manipulations, we have
$$
B_{n,h} = A_{nn} + \sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}}\left[\binom{2n-2}{n-k(h+1)} - \binom{2n-2}{n-1+k(h+1)}\right].
$$
But if we try to find a combinatorial interpretation to this sum in terms of bounded lattice paths, we fail: the destination point has coordinates $(n,n-2)$, which is below the inferior boundary $y = x - 1$, so the number of paths is $0$, but Mohanty's formula gives negative numbers in this kind of situation (although he does not mention this). Therefore, if we find a combinatorial interpretation for the absolute value of these numbers, we can understand the result in the same terms.]</p>

The complete separating system requires for any pair of coordinates at least one vector such that the first coordinate is zero and the second one, and at least one other vector the other way.</p>

<p>A classical question is the minimal size of a separating system on an $n$ element universe. I am interested in the literature of the following generalization of the classical question:</p>

<p>Consider vectors with coordinates $\{1,\ldots,k\}$ and a graph $G$ with vertex set $\{1,\ldots,k\}$. We would like the vectors to be a separating system with respect to coordinates $(i,j)$ if this is an edge of $G$. By being a separating system with respect to $(i,j)$ I mean that for any pair of coordinates there is at least one vector such that the first coordinate is $i$ and the second $j$ or vice versa. How many vectors do we need to satisfy all these requirements?</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in a small special case where $k=3$, and where one of the edges mean a completely separating system. But i doesn't seem to be fortunate enough to find any results of this type. </p>

<p><strong>My question is</strong>: Are there any results of this type?</p>

"<h2>Problem statement</h2>

<p>Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph whose vertices are either black or white. A <em>local complementation</em> of $G$ with respect to a black vertex $v$ consists in:</p>

<ol>
<li>complementing the subgraph induced by $v$ and its neighbours,</li>
<li>flipping the colour of each neighbour of $v$ (i.e. black vertices become white and conversely), and finally</li>
<li>removing $v$ from $V$.</li>
</ol>

<p>The goal is to delete the whole graph using only local complementations.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>Given an ordering $\mathcal O$ of the vertices of $V$, can we characterise cases in which  $\mathcal O$ allows us (or not) to delete $G$?</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>A lot of work on local complementations (or ""vertex eliminations"" in some papers) concerns itself with algorithmic issues, especially with finding orderings that will work. Note that this differs from my question, since here you don't get to choose an ordering. </p>

<p>Of course, verifying whether an ordering works is easy: keep complementing until you're done or stuck. Finding necessary or sufficient nontrivial structural conditions on $G$ or $\mathcal O$ seems harder. Does this problem ring any bell?</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Two different orderings for the same graph; the first one does not work:</p>

<p>The second one does:</p>

"<p><em>I'm not sure if this is a soft question, or should be community wiki.</em> </p>

<p>I was explaining to a student how to prove that two sets were equal using what I called the 'oldest trick in the book': to show that $A = B$, prove $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$. This got me thinking: what <strong>are</strong> the other ways of showing that two sets are equal. There's of course the bijection method (establish a 1-1 onto correspondence), but I couldn't think of others off the top of my head. </p>

<p>Are there many more general-ish techniques for proving two sets equal ? </p>

"<p>On a simple representation of a simple Lie algebra, there is a unique bilinear form called <strong>the Shapovalov form</strong> for which the actions of $E_i$ and $F_i$ are biadjoint, and some fixed highest weight vector has $\langle v_h,v_h\rangle=1$.  </p>

<p>The representation has a distinguished collection of vectors $F_{i_1}\cdots F_{i_n}v_h$ for all sequences $\mathbf{i}$.  One can calculate any inner product $\langle F_{i_1}\cdots F_{i_n}v_h, F_{j_1}\cdots F_{j_n}v_h\rangle$, by simply moving the $F_j$'s to become $E_j$'s on the other side, and commuting them past the $F_i$'s.  This is not hard to do computationally, but the formulas one gets are not positive, which is annoying for my purposes.  </p>

  <p>Does anyone know of positive formulae for these inner products?  What about their $q$-analogues for quantum groups?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  I should note, following Allen's comment: I'm pretty sure that I know a vector space that has the dimension which is this inner product.  There's also a positivity proof using the canonical basis (all the elements I'm interested in are <em>positive</em> linear combinations of canonical basis elements).</p>

Fix positive integers $x_1,\dots,x_r$ with $\gcd(x_1,\dots,x_r) = 1$, and let  $S = \lbrace a_1x_1 + \cdots a_rx_r\mid a_1,\dots,a_r\in\mathbb{N}_0\rbrace$ be the numerical semigroup generated by the $x_i$. The <em>representation number</em> of $n\in\mathbb{N}_0$ over $S$ is given by $R_S(n) = \vert\lbrace (a_1,\dots,a_r)\in\mathbb{N}_0^r\mid n = \sum a_ix_i\rbrace\vert$.

"<p>It has been proved by Moon and Moser in 1965 that any finite simple graph has at most $3^{|V|/3}$ maximal cliques.
