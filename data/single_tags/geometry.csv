<p><strong>Question</strong>: Consider two such figures A and B.  I am curious about whether there is a general method for detecting an intersection between A and B, assuming I only know the coordinates of the points of A and the points of B.</p>

<hr>

<p>Motivation: My friend is working on some kind of applied physics problem about colliding `trajectories.'  He asked me essentially the same question as the one posed above.  I thought about it for about an hour and a half before convincing myself that, if there is in fact a general method, the key should maybe be to look at what happens in the vicinity of corners and maximums and then try to exhaustively outline conditions for intersection.  The cases I came up with were: </p>

<ol>
<li>A and B just touch in a single point, so that they do not trespass into each other's interior--i.e., a corner of A pricks the outside of B or the maximum of A just touches the baseline of B from below.</li>
<li>A and B just touch in a single point, with all of A except this isolated point (the point of contact) lying strictly inside B.</li>
<li>A and B coincide in two points, so that either a corner or the maximum of A lies inside B.</li>
<li>A and B coincide in three points, whereby a `tail' of A lies in the interior of B, but the rest of A passes out of B.</li>
<li>A and B coincide in four points--A essentially squeezes through B.</li>
<li>A and B coincide in five points; similar to case 5 but the maximum of A also coincides with the maximum of B.</li>
<li>A and B coincide in a point and a common subset of each other's baselines by lying on the same horizontal and having their tails overlap.</li>
<li>A and B coincide in all points. </li>
</ol>

<p>But actually if one looks closely, I am pretty sure that all of the cases except the fifth one can be covered entirely by checking if either a corner or the maximum of A occurs on or inside the boundary of B.  So actually the problem should be reduced to checking two cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>Either a corner or the maximum of A occurs on or inside the boundary of B.</li>
<li>Neither the corner nor the maximum of A occurs on or inside the boundary of B.</li>
</ol>

<p>My idea is to run the following algorithm.  First for both A and B set aside the following special points: their left corners, their right corners, and their maximums.  Start with A and pick some $z$ out of its special points.  Retrieve, if they exist, the unique points $p_1$ and $p_2$ of B that have the same vertical coordinates as $z$ does and similarly retrieve the points $q_1$ and $q_2$ of B that have the same horizontal coordinates as $z$ does.  Compare them: If either $p_1$ or $p_2$ is identical to $q_1$ or $q_2$, then you know that the figures coincide in a special point of A, which handles cases 1, 3, 6, and 8; If the horizontal coordinate of $z$ is between those of $p_1$ and $p_2$ and if the vertical coordinate of $z$ is between those of $q_1$ and $q_2$, then you know that $z$ lies in the interior of B or somewhere on its baseline, handling cases 2, 4, and 7 (technically, these pairs of points are not well-defined in the seventh case because $p_1 = p_2 = z$ for instance, but you can just directly inspect for overlapping baselines by checking to see if the corners of A and B have the same vertical coordinates and if one of the corners of A (B) lies in between B's (A's) corners).  However, I don't quite know how to test case 5--I thought there should be some checkable necessary and sufficient condition having to do with maximums, but it seems hard to do.  Presumably, you'd cycle through the five remaining special points if none of the above checks out.  </p>

<p><strong>Some follow-up questions are</strong>: Are my cases exhaustive?  If so, how do I check for case 5 and is there a way to do it in terms of my special points?  If my intuition is correct here, how do you formally argue for it?</p>

<p>All that I am doing in the above algorithm is just taking orthogonal projections onto horizontals and verticals, which is sensible from an intuitive geometric standpoint, since I am looking for instances of A and B crossing into each other.  I did some research later on and discovered that my thinking makes a great deal of contact with the idea of the separation theorem for convex polygons and that my algorithm seems in fact to be almost a direct application of that theorem.  (After all, you could just treat the figures under consideration as the limiting case, right?) </p>

<p><strong>Added</strong>: Actually, I think I was seeing ghosts and it should be pretty simple to handle the fifth case--all you have to do is check to see if the baseline of A lies between the baseline of B and the maximum of B.</p>

Here is what Ive don so far, again that I posting the equations in a programing form Iam a bit in a hurry</p>

<pre><code>//assume  sepration angle  = 1/3 group angle for simplness , I have no idea why I did this 
    var groupAngle = 360 / (noGroups * 1.333);
    var sepAngle = (1 / 3) * groupAngle;
    //mathmatical relation  
    var groupRadius = Math.sin((groupAngle * Math.PI / 180) / 2) *R;
</code></pre>

<p>after I assumed the above I used the angles to find the center for each circle then draw it - I used sin and cos to find the center relative to the canvas I have which wasn't a problem - however the problem is which I know from the start that I should define R in away the circles will never get out of the rectangle you notice the cut out circles but for not to make things more complicated than they already r I decide R should be some how little bit less than the height of the rectangle <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/22tDP.png"" rel=""nofollow"">result image</a>
Now to solve this problem I decided after the calculation and before centering my circles I will reduce the R to R-r this way all circles are shifted inside since eventually I will delete the bigger circles and have the other circles aligned correctly - I cant post another picture -</p>

<p>what remains here that If you keep reducing N, r gets larger to some how it miss up the whole drawing I need to restrict r to another value  </p>

  <p>The gift wrapping principle works as follows: Let <em>C</em> be a polyhedron with <em>n</em> vertices. Assuming a face <em>f</em> of <em>C</em> is given, select an edge of <em>f</em>. This edge and every vertex of <em>C</em> determine a plane; a new face of <em>C</em> belongs to the plane forming with <em>f</em> the largest convex angle. </p>

<p>Now this passage doesn’t make much sense to me and I was hoping someone out there could help me understand it. First, I always thought that in order to determine a plane you need two points in the plane and a normal vector with that plane. I’m assuming the two points in the plane come from the edge but how can any vertex be normal to a plane containing the points.

$$R=\frac{r_1^2+r_2^2-\sqrt{2}r_1r_2}{2r_1-\sqrt{2}r_2}$$

$$\theta = 2\arctan\left(\left(2\left(\frac{R}{r_2}\right)^2-1\right)^{-1/2}\right)$$</p>

<p>Now returning to the question: We assume that the speed at which the racecar is going at any point in the turn is proportional to $\sqrt{r}$, where $r$ is the radius of turning at that point (i.e. the curvature at that point is $1/r$). </p>

  <p>For a track with constant width $r_2-r_1$ (with $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}r_2&lt;r_1&lt;r_2$), is the route through a quarter-circle turn that minimizes the time spent in said turn given by a section of a circle with length $\theta R$ (as seen in the figure)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason I think it is given by $\theta R$ is based purely on intuition.</p>

<p>I guess the problem will most easily be solved using calculus of variations, as it is somewhat similar to the Brachistochrone problem (with the added constraint of the width of the track), but I don't know how to attack it. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/444289/shortest-path-and-minimum-curvature-path-implementation"">This question</a> addresses the more general question of finding the optimal route around a track, but has an algorithmic approach instead. If someone coincidentally has a script with such an $A*$ algorithm at hand, they could test it on a quarter-circle turn and see whether or not the route of least curvature follows the arc of a bigger circle?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> As <em>Jens</em> has suggested in the comments, some kind of speed limit should be introduced. I think it is sufficient to demand that the function given by the speed of the car should be differentiable (after all, infinite acceleration isn't very realistic).</p>

"<p>Knowing that the acute angles of the trapezoid are $60^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ and the difference of the squares of base lenghts is equal to 100, calculate the area of this trapezoid.</p>

<p>Here's my solution: Let a be the shorter and b the longer base. By drawing two lines from the ends of a perpendicular to b, we form two right triangles. One of them has angles $45^\circ-45^\circ-90^\circ$ and the second is $60^\circ-30^\circ-90^\circ$. Using the properties of these triangles, we can see that the side of the first triangle lying on b is equal to h=height (both lie between 45 and 90) and the side of the latter which is lying on b is equal to $\frac{h\sqrt{3}}3$. Then, $b-a=h+\frac{h\sqrt{3}}3$ so $h=\frac{3(b-a)}{3+\sqrt{3}}=(b-a)(1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3})$. We just plug it into the initial equation and we get that the total area is $50(1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3})$.</p>

<p>Answer to a comment of Amzoti:
To prove Relation (1) I first prove the relation:
$$AB^2=4R_gR_b\quad (2)$$
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/NlmgG.png"" alt=""Two Circles"">
Relation (2) is a consequence of Pythagoras' theorem in the triangle $O_bO_gH$:
$$AB^2+(R_g-R_b)^2=(R_b+R_g)^2\,.$$
(It was the previous Sengaku in the book.)</p>

<p>We thus get the relations
$$
\begin{align}
AB^2 &amp; =4R_gR_b\quad (2) \\
AC^2 &amp; =4R_gR_r\quad (3) \\
BC^2 &amp; =4R_bR_r\quad (4) \\
\end{align}
$$
where $A$, $B$, $C$ are the orthogonal projections of the centers of the circles $C_b$, $C_g$ and $C_r$ on the line $d$. The relation $AB^2=AC^2+BC^2+2AC.BC$ then yields, using Relations (2) to (4),
$$4R_gR_b=4R_gR_r+4R_bR_r+8\sqrt{R_bR_g}R_r$$
Divided by $4R_rR_gR_b$ this equation is
$$\frac{1}{R_r}=\Big(\frac{\sqrt{R_g}+\sqrt{R_b}}{\sqrt{R_bR_g}}\Big)^2$$
which is in fact Relation (1) squared.</p>

<p>“The Solid Angle Factor (SAF) is defined as the solid angle of the ligand cone comprising the metal at the apex and the primary coordinating atom or group (the first-order SAF) or the whole ligand (the second-order SAF) divided by 4π. <strong>Geometrically, it refers to the ratio of the projected area to 4π, i.e. the area of the sphere surface.</strong> It actually represents the size of the ligand as viewed from the metal centre towards the ligand. The sum of the values of SAF of all the ligands coordinated to the metal centre represents the total occupancy of the ligands in the coordination sphere. It is apparent that this occupancy should not reach unity because there are gaps and holes among the ligands.” (Polyhedron Vol. 6, No. 5, pp. 104-1048, 1987) (See <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/g2f97bn97yq56vu/xi-zhang1987.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/g2f97bn97yq56vu/xi-zhang1987.pdf?dl=0</a>)</p>

<p>In other words the solid angle is related to the projection of an 'outer' 'ligand' (sphere of known radius) onto the surface of a central ('metal' atom) sphere, as viewed from the center of the central sphere.
<strong>Solid angle factor (SAF) equation</strong>:</p>

<p>$$SAF=\frac{2\pi (1-\cos \Theta )}{4\pi } = \frac{1}{2}(1-\cos \Theta)$$</p>

<p>$$\theta =\sin^{-1}(\frac{\nu }{\iota })$$</p>

<p>, where ν = radius of the sphere of ligand/coordinating atom (This is known),
l = distance between the center of the 'ligand' spheres to the center of the metal atom/ 'sphere'.</p>

<p>A correction (approximation) has been supplied for the case where 2 identical  'ligand' spheres (i.e. the spheres have identical radii) are partially overlapping and are equidistant from the metal center:</p>

<p>$$\Delta SAF = \frac{2(\frac{2\varphi (\pi \nu ^{2})}{360}-d\nu \sin \varphi )}{4\pi (\iota \cos \eta )^{^{2}}}$$</p>

<p>(See link above and the following link:

These diagrams/equations illustrate what I understand of the the given correction equation, as well as the definition of the above symbols)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Derivation/equation for solid angle factor correction</strong>:
However, since there are multiple 'ligand' spheres around the metal several may partially overlap (or be perceived to overlap as viewed from the central 'metal' sphere) due to their close proximity to the metal, thereby resulting in the ‘observed’ solid angle factor being different from the calculated solid angle factor (without correction) from the metal.
The correction must consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>The distance from the central 'metal' sphere to the center of each 'ligand' sphere. (They are not necessarily equidistant)</li>
<li>The radius of each 'ligand' sphere (since they may have different (known) radii).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How would such an equation be derived and what would the equation be?</strong> Perhaps by considering 2 'ligand' spheres at a time? I am interested in the corrected (i.e. accurate) sum of all the SAF (known as the <strong>Solid Angle Sum (SAS)</strong>) of all the surrounding 'ligand' spheres, which should be &lt; or = 1.0.</p>

<p>However, a <a href=""http://maze5.net/?page_id=367"" rel=""nofollow"">simple geometric argument</a> shows that the central angle between any two legs of a simplex goes as $\theta = \mathrm{arccos}(-1/n)$.

  <p>Given $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there exists a $n$ such that we can find $n+1~$ <em>approximately mutually orthogonal</em> vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, up to tolerance $\epsilon$.

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I think one can squeeze at least $n+m$ for any $m$, via the following construction. Given $\epsilon$, one finds the $k$ such that you can have $k+1$ $\epsilon$-approximate mutually orthogonal unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^k$. Call these vectors $v_1, v_2, ..., v_k$. Then you could squeeze $mk+m$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{mk}$, by using the vectors

<p>The crucial step in drawing the boundaries that separate one phase
from another on these diagrams involves minimizing a free energy
function subject to basic physical conservation constraints.  I am
going to leave out the chemistry/physics and hope that we can move forward
with the minimization using Lagrange multipliers. </p>

<p>The free energy that is to be minimized is this:</p>

<p>$f^{(1)}x_1 + f^{(2)}x_2 = c_1,$</p>

<p>$f^{(1)} + f^{(2)} = 1. $</p>

<p>(and also that the $x_{i} > 0$ and $f^{(i)} > 0$, for $i=1,2$.)</p>

<p>The Lagrange formulation is:</p>

<p>$L(x_1,x_2,f^{(1)},f^{(2)},\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3) =
f^{(1)}G_{1}(x_1) + f^{(2)}G_{2}(x_2)$  </p>

<p>$- \lambda_{1}(f^{(1)}x_1 + f^{(2)}x_2 - c_1)$</p>

<p>$- \lambda_{2}(f^{(1)} + f^{(2)} - 1) $</p>

<p>The minimization of $\widetilde{G}$ follows from finding the $x_{i}$'s  that satisfy $\nabla L = 0:$</p>

<p>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}}   = f^{(1)}G_{1}'(x_1) - \lambda_{1}f^{(1)} = 0$</p>

<p>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_2}     = f^{(2)}G_{2}'(x_2) - \lambda_{1}f^{(2)} = 0$</p>

<p>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial f^{(1)}} = G_{1}(x_1) - \lambda_{1}x_{1} - \lambda_2 = 0$</p>

<p>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial f^{(2)}} = G_{2}(x_2) - \lambda_{1}x_{2} - \lambda_2 = 0$</p>

<p>which yields:</p>

<p>$(*) f^{(1)}\left[G_{1}'(x_1) - \lambda_1 \right] = 0$       </p>

<p>$(**) f^{(2)}\left[G_{2}'(x_2) - \lambda_1 \right]= 0 $       </p>

<p>$(***) G_{1}(x_1) - G_{2}(x_2) = \lambda_1 \left[ x_1 - x_2\right]$ </p>

<p>Because $f^{(1)}$ and $f^{(2)}$ are not to be zero, from (*) and (**) we have that </p>

<p>$G_{1}'(x_1) = G_{2}'(x_2) = \lambda_{1}.$</p>

<p>And, a manipulation of equation (***) looks like </p>

<p>$\frac{G_{1}(x_1) -G_{2}(x_2)}{x_1 - x_2} = \lambda_{1}.$</p>

<p>Now, think of $G_{i}$ as an even degree polynomial (which it isn't, but
it's graph sometimes resembles one) in the plane.  Let the points $x_1$
and $x_2$ be locations along the x-axis that lie roughly below the
minima of this curve.  The constraints (*),(*<em>), and (*</em>*) describe the
condition that the line drawn between $(x_1,G_{1}(x_1))$ and $(x_2,G_{2}(x_2))$ form a common tangent
to the ""wells"" of the curve.  It is these points $x_1$ and $x_2$,
which represent concentrations of pure components in our alloy, that
become mapped onto a phase diagram.  It is essentially by repeating this procedure for many
temperatures that we can trace out the boundaries in the desired phase diagram.</p>

<p><strong>The question is:</strong>  Looking at this from a purely analytic geometry
perspective, <strong>how would one derive the ""variational"" approach to find a common tangent line that we seem to have found using the above Lagrangian?</strong>  (warning: I don't really know how to
model things using variational methods.)  </p>

<p><strong>And, secondly:</strong> I have presented a model of a binary alloy, meaning
two variables to keep track of representing concentrations.  I have
been working on ternary alloys, where this free energy $\widetilde{G}$
is a function of three variables (two independent: $x_1,x_2,x_3$,
where $x_3 = 1- x_1 - x_2$) and is therefore a surface over a Gibbs
triangle.  Then $\nabla L = 0$ produces partial derivatives that no
longer ""speak geometry"" to me, although the solution is a common tangent
plane.  (I have attempted to characterize a common tangent plane
based purely in analytic geometry - completely disregarding the
Lagrangian - and have come up with several relations between
directional derivatives... <strong>How might directional derivatives relate
to the optimality conditions set forth by the Lagrangian?</strong>)</p>

<p>After reading Kaj Hansen's comment and trying a bit this is what I did, it still won't work though.</p>

<p>In a triangle, $tan(\theta)=\frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{adjecent side}}$. The slope of a line is $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$. Therefor the slope of the red line is $\tan(\theta)$; the formula of the line is $y=\tan(\theta)\cdot x$. </p>

<p>The formula of the ellipse is $\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$. When I put the two formulas together I get 
$$\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{(\tan(\theta)\cdot x)^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$$</p>

<p>After a bit of rearranging:</p>

<p>$$x=\pm \sqrt{\frac{a^{2}\cdot b^{2}}{a^{2}\cdot (\tan(\theta))^{2}+b^{2}}}$$</p>

<p>$$$$</p>

<p>$$y=\tan(\theta)\cdot x$$</p>

<p>$$y=\pm \tan(\theta) \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a^{2}\cdot b^{2}}{a^{2}\cdot (\tan(\theta))^{2}+b^{2}}} $$</p>

<p>Now with the help of Pythagoras' theorem $c=\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}$ the red line should be </p>

<p>$$\sqrt{\left ( \sqrt{\frac{a^{2}\cdot b^{2}}{a^{2}\cdot (\tan(\theta))^{2}+b^{2}}}\right ) ^{2}+\left ( \tan(\theta) \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a^{2}\cdot b^{2}}{a^{2}\cdot (\tan(\theta))^{2}+b^{2}}} \right )^{2}}$$</p>

<p>which can be simplified:</p>

<p>$$\sqrt{\frac{a^{2}\cdot b^{2} \cdot (\tan(\theta))^{2}+a^{2}\cdot b^{2}}{a^{2}\cdot (\tan(\theta))^{2}+b^{2}}}$$</p>

<p>This, however, does not give the right answer. Let's try something:</p>

"<p>I'm trying to prove that, as Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt%27s_linkage#Shape_traced_by_the_linkage"" rel=""nofollow"">says</a>, ""when the lengths of its bars and its base are chosen to form a crossed square, it traces the lemniscate of Bernoulli"" I'm using the setup described <a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iIN_2WjBH1cC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;redir_esc=y#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> (Although, they have a mistake the fixed point in the text should be D, as in the diagram), but all multiplied by a factor of 2.</p>

<p>So I decided to use vectors to prove it.</p>

<p>Let the point B and C have position vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{x}'$ respectivelly. And the point (1, 0) be $\vec{a}$ . Then the constraints are:
$$\begin{gather}
(\vec{x}'-\vec{a}) \cdot (\vec{x}'-\vec{a}) =2 \\
(\vec{x}+\vec{a}) \cdot (\vec{x}+\vec{a}) =2.\end{gather}$$</p>

<p>Also, if we let $\vec{X}$ be the position vector to trace the lemniscate, then:
$$\vec{X}=\vec{x}+1/2(\vec{x}'-\vec{x})=1/2(\vec{x}'+\vec{x})=1/2(\vec{x}'-\vec{a}+\vec{x}+\vec{a}).$$</p>

<p>Now,
$$\begin{align}
(\vec{X} \cdot \vec{X})^2
&amp;=(1/4((\vec{x}'-\vec{a}) \cdot (\vec{x}'-\vec{a})+(\vec{x}+\vec{a}) \cdot (\vec{x}+\vec{a})+2(\vec{x}'-\vec{a}) \cdot (\vec{x}+\vec{a})))^2 \\ 
&amp;=(1/4(4+2(\vec{x} \cdot \vec{x}'-\vec{a} \cdot \vec{x} +\vec{a} \cdot \vec{x}' -\vec{a} \cdot \vec{a}))^2 \\
&amp;=(1/2(1+xx'+yy'-x+x'))^2\end{align}.$$</p>

<p>From which I just can't get the required $2(X^2-Y^2)=1/2((x+x')^2-(y+y')^2)$ on the RHS to make the algebraic equation for the lemniscate. In particular, I can't get any $y^2$ or $y'^2$. So what am I doing wrong?</p>

I'm in 9th grade, and am trying to get into all of this stuff just so that I can win a few math competitions, and just become a better math student overall.</p>

<p>I'm starting off with inequalities, which seem very prevalent in olympiad math. They seem quite daunting to me, but I guess if I start step by step, I'll improve with a lot of practice.</p>

<p>To start off learning inequalities, I've begun with the AM-GM Inequality, learning it, practising &amp; perfecting it. In addition to this, I check out some external sources like the Cauchy-Schwarz Master Class, which was a book suggested to me by another user on this website. I skimmed through it very quickly, and it turned out to be something I was looking for. It has a section on AM-GM Inequality, which is what I'm starting with, which is nice. I'll be proceeding to Cauchy-Schwarz straight after, I guess.</p>

<p>I have trouble kind of understanding what it is some people do with AM-GM though. I also see many authors and people use AM-GM to solve a particularly daunting inequality which I could NEVER solve. When they explain their logic, and how they may use the AM-GM inequality to solve the problem, hey, it makes sense, it actually is logical and I can kind of appreciate how they did it all. But I don't understand where they get all these ideas and solutions from, I feel like I'm supposed to memorize whatever number of cases there are for AM-GM, and to somehow apply them when I'm faced with another question involving it. I don't know how to become necessarily proficient at it.</p>

<p>Since I'm super new to this, the only thing I'm really doing is reading the Cauchy-Schwarz Master Class, practicing a few of these AM-GM problems on AoPS forums, and looking up YouTube tutorials regarding AM-GM whenever I can.</p>

<p>If someone could help me out with learning AM-GM further, that would be very helpful. </p>

<p>Also, if you guys don't mind-- as a separate super noob question, I must ask,</p>

<p>The author of the Cauchy-Schwarz Master Class takes the inequality,</p>

<p>$xy &lt; (x^2 / 2) + (y^2 / 2)$</p>

<p>Which makes perfect sense to me, and then he says:</p>

<p>Let's replace x and y with their square roots, and then go on from there, which I don't really get.</p>

<p>Would we then get,</p>

<p>$\sqrt{xy} &lt; (x / 2) + (y / 2)$?</p>

<p>They then end up with,</p>

<p>$4\sqrt{xy}&lt; 2x + 2y$,</p>

<p>I see the author relates that inequality to the areas &amp; perimeters of squares and rectangles, which I kind of understand. Could we use that fact to then apply the AM-GM inequality to optimization problems for rectangles/squares? </p>

<p>I don't completely understand how the author got $4sqrt(xy) &lt; 2x + 2y$, I also don't understand how that inequality relates to anything. If I were to guess, I guess I'd say 4 times the square root of the area of the rectangle, will always be less than the perimeter of the square?</p>

<p>I'm in 9th grade and a COMPLETE beginner when it comes to this, so help would be really greatly appreciated. I just need someone to clear up things for me.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Let $A,B \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ disjoint, nonempty, closed and convex sets. Then there exists a $h \in \mathbb{R}^n$, such that $A$ and $B$ gets separated in the following way:
$$
 \langle b, h \rangle \le \langle a, h \rangle \quad \forall a \in A, b \in B.
$$
I have the following proof: Consider $C := B - A$, which is convex too. Because $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, it must be that $0 \notin C$. (*) Then there exists a $h$ such that $\langle c, h \rangle \le 0$ for all $c \in C$ or $\langle c, h \rangle \ge 0$ for all $c \in C$. WLOG let $\langle c, h \rangle \le 0$, then
$\langle b - a, h \rangle \le 0$, which means $\langle b, h \rangle - \langle a, h \rangle \le 0$, i.e. $$\langle b, h \rangle \le \langle a, h \rangle.$$</p>

<p>But (*) uses the fact that: For every convex set $X$ and a point $u \notin X$, there exists a $h$ such that $\langle u, h \rangle = 0$ and $\langle x, h \rangle \le 0$  for all $x \in X$ or $\langle x, h \rangle \ge 0$  for all $x \in X$.</p>

<p>Pardon my lack of talent with paint, but you get the idea. Points $a$ and $b$ have coordinates $(-x,y)$ and $(x,y)$ respectively. The equation for the ellipse in question is $x^2/4 + y^2 = 1$, which yields $y = \frac{\pm\sqrt{4-x^2}}{2}$ when rearranged, but the triangle is in the upper half so we can say that $y = \frac{\sqrt{4-x^2}}{2}$ for simplicity. Both $a$ and $b$ are at a distance of $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ from the origin, and a distance of $2x$ from each other. Since this is an equilateral triangle, we can say that $$2x = \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \hspace{5 mm} \text{and}$$</p>

<p>I was able to show that the second affirmation implies the first one:</p>

<p>Consider a triangle ABC. Let M be the midpoint of AB. Mark P such that the angle PMA = 90° = PBM. Now, let N be the midpoint of BC. Using the second statement, there is only one line passing through N parallel to MP. This line can't be orthogonal to BC, otherwise we would have  a triangle with two rect angles. So, the line passing through N perpendicular to BC meets PM in a point O. Now, it's easy to construct such a circle.</p>

"<p>Open problem in Geometry/Number Theory.  The real question here is:</p>

<p><em>Is there an infinite family of points on $y=x^2$, for $x \geq 0$, such that the distance between each pair is rational?</em></p>

<p>The question of ""if not infinite, then how many?"" follows if there exists no infinite family of points that satisfies the hypothesis.</p>

<p>We have that there exists a (in fact, infinitely many) three point families that satisfy the hypothesis by the following lemma and proof.</p>

<p><strong>Lemma 1:</strong>  <em>There are infinitely many rational distance sets of three points on $y=x^2$.</em></p>

<p>The following proof is by Nate Dean.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em>  Let $S$ be the set of points on the parabola $y = x^2$ and let $d_1$ and $d_2$ be two fixed rational values.  For any point, $P_0(r)=(r, r^2) \in S$, let $C_1(r)$ be the circle of radius $d_1$ centered at $P_0(r)$ and let $C_2(r)$ be the circle of radius $d_2$ centered at $P_0(r)$.  Each of these circles must intersect $S$ in at least one point. Let $P_1(r)$ be any point in $C_1(r) \cap S$ and likewise, let $P_2(r)$ be any point in $C_2(r) \cap S$.  Now let $dist(r)$ equal the distance between $P_1(r)$ and $P_2(r)$. The function $dist(r)$ is a continuous function of $r$ and hence there are infinitely many values of $r$ such that $P_0(r)$, $P_1(r)$,
and $P_2(r)$ are at rational distance. $ \blacksquare $</p>

<p>This basically shows that the collection of families of three points that have pairwise rational distance on the parabola is dense in $S$.</p>

<p>Garikai Campbell has shown that there are infinitely many nonconcyclic rational distance sets of four points on $y = x^2$ in the following paper: <a href=""http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2004-73-248/S0025-5718-03-01606-5/S0025-5718-03-01606-5.pdf"">http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2004-73-248/S0025-5718-03-01606-5/S0025-5718-03-01606-5.pdf</a></p>

<p>However, to my knowledge, no one has come forward with 5 point solutions, nor has it been proven that 5 point solutions even exist.</p>

<p>But I know that many people have not seen this problem!  Does anyone have any ideas on how to approach a proof of either the infinite case or even just a 5 point solution case?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  The above Lemma as well as the paper by Garikai Campbell do <strong>not</strong> include the half-parabola ($x \geq 0$) restriction.  However, I thought that the techniques that he employed could be analogous to techniques that we could use to make progress on the half-parabola version of the problem.</p>

<li>Use the map $f_2:z \mapsto z+ \alpha$ where $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ we will determine later. This simply takes the right half plane to the right half plane.</li>
<li>Use the map $f_3:z \mapsto z^2$ to map the right half plane to $\mathbb{C}$ with a cut along the negative reals.</li>
<li>Use the map $f_4:z \mapsto z+i$ to move the cut up and map to $\mathbb{C} \setminus S$.</li>

"<p>I'm about to grow lettuces on a hydroponic system and I was wondering what would be the ideal pattern to provide each lettuce with the max space.
Would it be better to plant them according to a grid like on the picture below or to a ""brick"" pattern such as ""one row of 5, then one row of 4 and so on"" or any other even better pattern?
The number of pots is currently 16, but I don't mind slightly altering this if this is required by an ideal pattern.
Obviously, this must also include the space from the last pots/rows to the edges of the total rectangle.

"<p>Consider the 'lens' described by $\{z:|z-i|&lt;\sqrt{2}\ \text{and}\ |z+i|&lt;\sqrt{2} \}$ . We want to map this to the upper right quadrant using a Möbius transformation.</p>

<p>The two circles meet at $z=1,-1$ and so if we use the map $f:z \mapsto  \frac{z-1}{z+1}$ we should send the lens to a sector centered on the origin.</p>

<p>I have two questions:</p>

<li>How do we find the angle sweeped out by the sector? As $f$ is conformal, it will be equal to the angle at which the two circles meet; but how is this calculated? And is there some general method for working this out?</li>
<li>After finding this angle, how do we work out how the sector is rotated relative to say the real axis after applying $f$? Again, is there some general way of doing this also?</li>

<p>After establishing this, the question becomes simple as we can use a power map to adjust to the correct angle and then a rotation to position the sector.</p>

I could be wrong with this information, but the point is I've taken many different approaches at this problem but have gotten no correct answers. I've taken it ""outside of the box"" and expanded the 480 line until i can drop it down to the end point and make the spot where those two lines meet a right angle, if that makes sense. I've used ""sohcahtoa"" and found out the lengths of that small right triangle, added it with the lengths of the large obtuse triangle to put it all together. The missing side is the hypotenuse and I used the Pythagorean theorem to find it, but the answer comes out wrong. I tried so many different values and processes, and nothing.

What do you suppose is meant by $x_e$ in this case? Is it $x=e$ or $x$ such that $y=e$ or ?  I could put the whole problem here, but I hope to solve it myself once I understand the notation.</p>

<p>My translation:</p>

<p>$M_1(x_1,x_y)\,M_2(x_2,y_2)$ are two points on the graph of $y=\ln x$.
$I(x_e,y_0)$ is the middle of the chord $M_1 M_2$. According to the
concavity of the graph  $y_0 &lt; \ln x_0$; deduce $2 \sqrt{x_1 x_2} &lt; x_1 + x_2$.</p>

<p>Update: given GPerez's comment below which agrees with a thought I had too about $x_e$, I'd say it's possible (but not yet conclusive in my mind) the book has a typo and $x_0$ was meant instead. </p>

<p>Update: my thought process on solving the problem was approximately thus: since $y=\ln x$ is concave, if $M_1$ is negative, then $0&lt;x_1&lt;1$ since $\ln x &lt; 0$ for $0 &lt; x &lt; 1$. If $x_e$ wasn't a typo, I had supposed that, since it was the x-coordinate of the midpoint of $M_1 M_2$ it might mean that $M_2$ had to be located to the right of either where $y$ attains the value $e$ or where $x=e$, and knowing this would indicate that $M_2$ is to the right of that point since it is the right endpoint. From these facts, we would then deduce that $0&lt;x_1&lt;1$ and (for the case where we suppose $x_e$ means $x=e$:) $e&lt;x_2&lt;\cdot$ where $\cdot$ here is some value to the right of $x_2$ or (for the case where we suppose that $x_e$ means $y=e$:) $1&lt;x_2&lt;\cdot$ where $\cdot$ here is some value to the right of $x_2$. Then using the rules of logarithmic manipulation we could expand the LHS and RHS of the inequality given and compare term by term to prove it based on our knowledge of the range of possible values for $x_1$ and $x_2$ supposed above. That was my plan, but given the uncertainty of the notation and the incompletion, as of yet, of my computations, I've not concluded the solution. </p>

This postulate is the obvious statement that given a line $L$ and a point $p$ not on $L$ there are at least two lines through $p$ that do not meet $L$.

"<p>Does anyone know if it has been proved what the maximum number of simplexes occurring in the plane is for a given value of $n$ points? I am interested in this question in relation to packing problems (eventually generalizing to tetrahedron packing in 3-space).</p>

<p>In 1974, Harborth proved the following theorem by applying Euler's polyhedral formula and using induction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $f_{2}^{\text{min}}(n)$ denote the maximum number of times the minimum distance can occur among n points in the plane. Then, $$f_{2}^{\text{min}}(n) = \lfloor 3n - \sqrt{12n -3} \rfloor$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For any dimension $d$, we have a general definition for the maximum number of times the minimum distance can occur among $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ as, $$f_{d}^{\text{min}}(n) = \max_{|P|=n} | \{\overline{pq} | p,q \in P \text{ and } |p-q|=1\}|$$
where $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is any $n$-element point set. We now wish to extend this result to not only consider the maximum number of times the minimum distance can occur among $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, but to the maximum number of times a regular $k$-simplex of minimum side length can occur among $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$.</p>

<p>Toward the end, I define the $\Delta$-function as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $\widehat{v_{1}...v_{k}}$ denote a $k$-simplex with vertices $v_{1},...,v_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Then,
  $$\Delta_{d}^{k}(n) = \max_{|P|=n} | \{\widehat{v_{1}...v_{k}} | v_{1},...,v_{k} \in P, |v_{i}-v_{j}|=1, i\neq j\}|$$
  defines the maximum number of occurrences of a regular $k$-simplex of minimum edge length determined by an $n$-element point set in $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in terms of this $\Delta$-function, we have $f_{2}^{\text{min}}(n) = \Delta_{2}^{1}(n) = \lfloor 3n - \sqrt{12n -3} \rfloor$. I am now interested in extending Harborth's result to $\Delta_{2}^{2}(n)$ and in doing so I have proved the following corollary of two lemmas I proved (I will not mention the proofs).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any simplicial $k$-complex $\mathcal{K}$ for which $\Delta_{d}^{k}(n)=|\mathcal{K}|$ is connected and homogeneous, where $k \leq d$ for $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ with $|P|=n$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I now want to extend Harborth's result to determining $\Delta_{2}^{2}(n)$, that is, determining the maximum number of regular triangles of side length equal to the minimum distance that can occur among an $n$-element point set in the plane.</p>

<p>The start of my proof looks something like this, I am stuck though and am looking for guidance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By Corollary 1, we have that $\Delta_{2}^{2}(n)=|\mathcal{K}|$ where $\mathcal{K}$ is a connected homogeneous simplicial $2$-complex. By the necessity of homogeneity, $\partial \mathcal{K}$ is a closed polygon (is it necessarily convex?) with at most $n$-vertices. Let the degree of a vertex in $\mathcal{K}$ denote the number of adjacent vertices in $\mathcal{K}$. Then, let $b$ and $b_{d}$ denote the total number of vertices of $\partial \mathcal{K}$, and the number of those vertices that have degree $d$ in $\mathcal{K}$, respectively. Then, $b = b_{2} + b_{3} + b_{4} + b_{5}$. [From here, I don't know where to go, I want to employ Euler's polyhedron formula somehow. If $\partial \mathcal{K}$ is convex, could I say $\Delta_{2}^{2} = 2 - n + E(n)$, where $E(n)$ is a function which determines the number of edges of $\mathcal{K}$? Any ideas for how to determine E(n)?]</p>

But I can't seem to generalize this to four dimensions. Is there not a unique geodesic curve that passes through two points? If there is, how would I express it in terms of the two points?</p>

"<p>I know that the involute of circle of radius $r$ centered at $(0,0)$ is given by the following parametric form:
$$\begin{cases}
x(\theta) = r \big(\cos(\theta) + \theta\ \sin(\theta) \big),\\
y(\theta) = r\big(\sin(\theta) - \theta\ \cos(\theta) \big),
\end{cases}$$
with $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$. Given a point $(a,b)\in\mathbb{R}^2$, I would like to compute its distance to the involute (or the closest point on the involute).</p>

<p>Given the parametric form I can compute the normal direction to the involute at a point and, thus, I need to compute a $t\in\mathbb{R}$ such that 
$$(a,b) = \big(x(\theta),y(\theta)\big) \ + \ t\ \big(-y'(\theta),x'(\theta)\big).$$
I guess that now the <em>easiest</em> way consists on computing $\theta$ first, which gives the closest point:
$$\frac{x(\theta)-a}{y'(\theta)}-\frac{b-y(\theta)}{x'(\theta)}=0.$$
It is obvious that one needs iterative solvers to approximate the solution (I have already tried Newton-Raphson).</p>

<p>The main problem is that the function to be minimized is highly oscillating and it can be difficult to give a good approximation for the initialization of the algorithm. In fact, it seems that this should also depend on the radius $r$.</p>

<p>Any help or suggestion is really welcome: from a geometrical point of view (a way to simplify the computations, an already computed formula...), from a numerical point of view (other algorithms) or from the implementation point of view.</p>

Assume that the fly and spider stay on their respective sides, but aside from that, their points are not necessarily where they are placed on the diagram. <strong>Is there a general formula for calculating the shortest distance between the spider and the fly?</strong> (Is there a general formula for the geodesic of the cuboid?)</p>

<p>I solved the original spider and the fly problem (by just creating meshes of the cube and getting lucky), but I don't see how I could generalize the result, especially as the spider and fly do not have to be at the same position they are in the original problem. In the original problem, the spider is centered and one unit from the top, and the fly is centered and one unit from the bottom. I've tried considering the simpler case where the fly and spider remain in the same spot, but I still couldn't generalize it, especially for more extreme cases (if we make the height <em>very</em> large compared to the others, our line will go off the mesh, I'm not sure how to deal with this.)</p>

<p>I looked online for any hints about the problem, and the <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SpiderandFlyProblem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">the Mathworld Page</a>
 used the word ""geodesic"" to describe the solution. I did some more research, but could only find solutions for the sphere and some other 3d shapes. I also couldn't find any page describing a general solution to the problem, only pages using the meshes of the rectangular prism as a solution.</p>

<p><strong>Let's forget the code and focus only on coordinates of vertices.</strong> <br/></p>

<p>When I look on coordinates from wiki and divide <code>φ/1</code> its ≈ 1.618. <br/>
When I do same with coordinates from the code above 0.42/0.26 ≈ 1.615 <br/> 
So when I compare this two sets of coordinates I can say that 1 corresponds with 0.26 and 0.42 with <code>φ</code>. <br/>
If lets say that k = 1/0.26 = 50/13 ≈ 3.84, so if I multiply all coordinates from second set by k, I can write them as: <br/></p>

<pre><code>(±1, 0 ,±φ) 
(0, ±φ, ±1)
(±φ, ±1, 0)

<p>So for conclusion:<br/>
Wiki coordinates:</p>

<pre><code>(0, ±1, ± φ)
(±1, ± φ, 0) 
(± φ, 0, ±1)

<p>Second set coordinates: <br/></p>

<pre><code>(±1, 0 ,±φ) 
(0, ±φ, ±1)
(±φ, ±1, 0)

"<p>The Minkowski lower bound for packing hyperspheres of unit radii in $\mathbb{R}^n$ states that the density of hyperspheres satisfies, for all $n\geq 2$

<p>My question is whether boundary conditions in the definition of density affect the asymptotic behavior of this bound. Any reasonable definition of density would be something like:
\begin{equation}
\Delta_n = \lim_{\rho \rightarrow \infty} \frac{N(\rho \mathscr{B}_n)}{\mu(\rho \mathscr{B}_n)},

\begin{equation}

"<p>I'm interested in finding the maximum area ellipse that does not cover some points $\mathbf{p}_i$ and that is centered at the origin. Hence, ideally I'd like to solve this optimization problem:

\operatorname{subject to} &amp; \boldsymbol \Sigma \succeq \mathbf{0} \\
&amp; \mathbf{p}_i^T \boldsymbol \Sigma^{-1} \mathbf{p}_i \ge 1 \quad \forall i
\end{array}
$$
The ellipse would be thus defined by the equation $\mathbf{p}_i^T \boldsymbol \Sigma^{-1} \mathbf{p}_i = 1$. Is there a known/reliable method to solve such a problem (with many $\mathbf{p}_i$)?</p>

<p>What I've tried:
Substituting $\boldsymbol \Omega=\boldsymbol \Sigma^{-1}$ doesn't help:
 $$
\begin{array}{rl}
\operatorname{minimize} &amp; \det \boldsymbol \Omega \\
\operatorname{subject to} &amp; \boldsymbol \Omega \succeq \mathbf{0} \\
&amp; \mathbf{p}_i^T \boldsymbol \Omega\,\mathbf{p}_i \ge 1 \quad \forall i
\end{array}
$$
The constraints are nice and convex (linear matrix inequality and a set of scalar linear inequalities), the problem is the objective function which is concave, hence no go.</p>

<p>You can give a sort of estimate to the solution by replacing the objective with $\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol\Omega$; this would make the objective linear and would also be equivalent (at least in the 2D case) to maximizing $\displaystyle\frac{\det\boldsymbol\Sigma}{\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol\Sigma}$, which is kind of similar, but not really the same.</p>

<p>Also, my gut tells me that the optimal ellipse should cross three of the $\mathbf{p}_i$ points. This implies that you could find the optimum by enumerating all sets of three points, fitting an ellipse through them (if possible), checking if all other points fall outside, and keeping the ellipse with the largest area. For pathological cases you could then also check all combinations of two points by fitting the maximum area ellipse passing through them...</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that: (a) I don't know if it is in fact optimal, it's merely a gut feeling (b) I don't like it, it's sort of brute force and it has $\Theta(n^4)$ time complexity.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
As MvG pointed out, the solution to the problem is unbounded. So let us consider the additional constraint $\boldsymbol\Sigma\preceq\sigma\mathbf{I}$ (equivalently $\boldsymbol\Omega\succeq\frac{\mathbf{I}}{\sigma}$)</p>

"<p>I am confused by a step made in a proof of the following result.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $f_{2}^{\text{min}}(n)$ denote the maximum number of times the minimum distance can occur among n points in the plane. Then $f_{2}^{\text{min}}(n) = \lfloor 3n - \sqrt{12n-3} \rfloor$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proof: Assume $n \geq 3$ and consider a set $P$ of $n$ points with minimum distance 1, and connect two elements of $P$ by a segment if and only if their distance is exactly 1. Thus, we obtain a graph $G$ embedded in the plane. Assume that $G$ has the largest possible number of edges; that is, $|E(G)|=f_{2}^{\text{min}}(n)$. It is easy to see that every vertex of $G$ is adjacent to at least two other vertices. Moreover, $G$ is two-connected; that is, $G$ remains connected after the removal of any of its vertices.
The outer face of $G$ is bounded by a simple closed polygon $C$. Let $b$ and $b_{d}$ denote the total number of vertices of this polygon and the number of those vertices that have degree $d$ in $G$, respsectively. Clearly, $b = b_{2} + b_{3} + b_{4} + b_{5}$. The internal angle of $C$ at a vertex of degree $d$ is at least $(d-1)\frac{\pi}{3}$, and the sum of these angles is $(b-2)\pi$. Hence, $b_{2} + 2b_{3} + 3b_{4} + 4b_{5} \leq 3b-6$.
[Important Part]:</p>

<p>On the other hand, denoting by $f_{i} (i \geq 3)$ the number of internal faces of $G$ with $i$ sides, we obtain from Euler's polyhedral formula that,
$$n - f_{2}^{\text{min}}(n) + f_{3} + f_{4} + ... = 1$$</p>

<hr>

<p>The proof then continues and I understand everything before and after where it is mentioned that $n - f_{2}^{\text{min}}(n) + f_{3} + f_{4} + ... = 1$, but how is this arrived at? It is likely a very very simple answer, but if you could explain with details how this is arrived at by Euler's polyhedral formula I would be able to understand the proof. Thank you.</p>

"<p>Today I've computed $$\zeta(3)=\frac{9}{8}+\frac{1}{27}\int_0^1\int_0^1\int_0^1\frac{dxdydz}{1-(xyz)^{1/3}}$$
using a well know method to get this kind of integrals, I say with geometric series. After, only from a scholar/academic viewpoint I am asking myself if are feasibles more calculations in the way that was in the literature. Since I believe that the answer is no, because is very difficult or impossible to get in a closed-form  $\zeta(3)$ with this method, only is required answer my <strong>Question</strong>. Then I can refresh this kind of calculations, that is an exercise to state the right identity of the formula for change of varibles in multivariate calculus: what is the (shape of the following) set $T\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ that is prescribed in such formula?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question.</strong> Can you explain (if you can draw a draft of such subset it is well) <strong>how do you calculate the set</strong> $T\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ <strong>prescribed from</strong> definition of $(u,v,w)$, see my calculations below, as a linear bijection (thus continuously differentiable) when my purpose was to use the <strong>theorem of change of variables for multivariable calculus</strong>? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>My definition will be</strong> (I haven't a mathematical reasoning to claim this choice) 
$$\begin{cases}
u=(x+y+z)/3 \\
v=(x-y+z)/3  \\
 w=(x+y-z)/3 \\
\end{cases} $$
thus inverting with elementary operations on the associated matrix of the corresponding liner transformation, one gets $$\begin{cases}
x=\frac{3}{2}(v+w)  \\
y=\frac{3}{2}(u-v)  \\
z=\frac{3}{2}(u-w).  \\
\end{cases} $$ </p>

<p>Thus using the cited theorem for the change of variable, that is calculate the absolute value of the <strong>Jacobi determinant</strong> and do the substitution in such formula one gets $$\int_0^1\int_0^1\int_0^1\frac{dxdydz}{1-(xyz)^{1/3}}=\int_{T}\frac{2(\frac{3}{2})^3dudvdw}{1-\frac{3}{2} \left( (v+w)(u-v)(u-w) \right)^{1/3} },$$
since as I've said the calculation for the absolute value of the Jacobi determinant was  $$  \left| \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^3 \det \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1
\end{pmatrix}  \right| =$$ $$=  \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^3 \left| 0\cdot\det \begin{pmatrix}
-1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1
\end{pmatrix} -\det \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; -1
\end{pmatrix} + \det \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix} \right|= 2\left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^3.$$</p>

<p>I hope that there are no typos. I revised the <strong>definition</strong> for $(u,v,w)$ and there are no typos. <strong>Many thanks.</strong></p>

"<p>I'm trying to implement a image processing feature descriptor based on this <strong><a href=""http://vision.eecs.ucf.edu/papers/mmsp42-scovanner.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">paper</a></strong>. After computing all relevant normals for specific keypoints and their neighbors in an image I want to perform orientation quantization by storing all normals in a weighted histogram.</p>

<p>For that purpose I try to span equally sized bins over a sphere (described by $\theta$ and $\phi$) by creating meridians and parallels. (see Figure 2 in paper)</p>

<p>The histogram should be of size 8×4 and therefore contain 32 bins. <strong>I understand that this leads to problems due to singularities at the poles since bins get progressively smaller</strong>: </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VfRmL.png"" width=""250"">
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/aHBqL.jpg"" width=""220""></p>

<p>To overcome this it is mentioned that we must normalize the values added to each bin by the area of the bin (also called 'solid angle'). The formula for calculating the solid angle is given as:</p>

<p>$$ \omega = \Delta \phi(cos \theta - cos( \theta + \Delta \theta))$$</p>

<p>I understand that  $\phi$ is measured from the <em>north pole</em> = 0&deg; to <em>south pole</em> = 180&deg; while $\theta$ is measured around the equator in the range of [0, 2&pi;]. What I don't understand is how exactly the normalization works.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/RY2v6.png"" width=""550""></p>

<p>Lets say I have a normal $N$ and I have computed the values $\phi \substack{N}$ and $\theta \substack{N}$ for it according to the second page of the paper. Next I compute the size in degrees that each Bin in the $8x4$ histogram has:</p>

<p>$$\frac{360^\circ}{8} = 45^\circ (theta) ; \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ (phi)$$</p>

<p>Now I can divide $\phi \substack{N}$ and $\theta \substack{N}$ by the corresponding bin size to get the actual number of the Bin in which the current normal should be stored:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{\Delta \phi}{90^\circ} = numberOfBinPhi$$
$$ \frac{\Delta \theta}{45^\circ} = numberOfBinTheta$$</p>

<p>Lets assume that this results in the following values:</p>

<p>$$ numberOfBinPhi = 1$$
$$ numberOfBinTheta = 3$$</p>

<p>Now the question is, how to compute the solid angle $\omega\substack{N}$ for such case? Is:</p>

<ul>
<li>$\Delta \phi = 90^\circ$  </li>
<li>$\Delta \theta = 45^\circ$</li>
<li>$\phi\substack{N} = 90^\circ * numberOfBinPhi = 90^\circ$</li>
<li>$\theta\substack{N} = 90^\circ * numberOfBinTheta = 135^\circ$</li>
</ul>

<p>and therefore:</p>

<p>$$ \omega = \Delta \phi(cos \theta - cos( \theta + \Delta \theta))$$</p>

<p>$$ = $$</p>

<p>$$ \omega = 90^\circ(cos135^\circ - cos( 135^\circ + 45^\circ))$$</p>

<p>I'm not sure, if my understandings are true so far, please point out any mistake or obstacle. Thank you!</p>

<p>Curve's Theorem seems pretty straight forward, except I am not given $|BP|$. Here is what I have:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\dfrac{AR}{RB}\cdot\dfrac{BP}{PC}\cdot\dfrac{CQ}{QA}=1&amp;\Rightarrow \dfrac{BP}{PC}=\dfrac{252}{162}\\
&amp;\Rightarrow\dfrac{BP}{PC}=\dfrac{14}{9}\\
&amp;\Rightarrow PC=\dfrac{9BP}{14}\qquad(\star).
\end{align}
However, I cannot figure out how to find $BP$. My initial thought is to use the angle bisector theorem as follows:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\dfrac{BP}{PC}=\dfrac{BA}{CA}&amp;\Rightarrow\dfrac{BP}{PC}=\dfrac{RA+RB}{AQ+QC}\\
&amp;\Rightarrow\dfrac{BP}{PC}=\dfrac{30}{30}\\
&amp;\Rightarrow\dfrac{BP}{PC}=1\\
&amp;\Rightarrow BP=PC.
\end{align}
This now tells us that
\begin{align}
BP&amp;=\dfrac{1}{2}BC\\
&amp;=\dfrac{1}{2}40\\
&amp;=20
\end{align}
Substituting this result into $(\star)$ gives
\begin{align}
PC&amp;=\dfrac{(9)(20)}{14}\\
&amp;=12.86

However, I am not sure this is correct. I am hoping someone can confirm correctness or point out where I have made errors.</p>

"<p>I recently realized the area formula of all polygons, and most basic figures can be proven from the areas of square and rectangle. For example if we know the area of rectangle, we can the area formula of parallelogram, then triangle and so on. That brings us to the question how to prove that the area of the square with side $a$ is $a^2$. </p>

<p>I just came upon ProofWiki article (<a href=""http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Area_of_Parallelogram/Rectangle"">http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Area_of_Parallelogram/Rectangle</a>), which showed me to get the area of rectangle from that of the square, which completes the rest of the link. But the square?</p>

<p>I see that for such a basic figure we need some axioms to get our foot down. One that I think is absolutely essential that that of a square of $1$ units has an area of $1$ unit square, from which we can generalize to bigger squares. Another I think which we used in the rectangle proof that, if a figure $A$ is divided into different pieces then the area of $A$ is the sum of the area of the different pieces.     </p>

<p>So my first question: what set of axioms are needed that best and unambiguously describe the area of figures?</p>

<p>Anyway, the one informal proof we are show in primary schools, that divided for example a $5 \cdot5
$ square into $25$ pieces of $1$ cm$^2$ (intuitively very plausible) fails to convince me. Somehow, we may generalize it to rational numbers, but what if the side is $\pi$? We cannot keep dividing it infinitely many times.</p>

<p>So the second question: How do we using the axioms find the area of the square? And is there any gap, when we move forward, for example with the rectangle? Thanks.</p>

<p>I've been trying to figure this out but the professor only gave an example in the $y^2 =P(x)$ form but this is $y^2 = P(x) /Q(x)$ so I'm a little confused how to go about plotting this, thanks in advance to those that can help.</p>

"<p>When rendering object onto a screen, one must often cut up their objects into quads and triangles to allow the computer to process them and finally draw them onto a screen.</p>

<p>I am trying to slice up a given piece of geometry and end up with solely triangles. Since I am trying to incorporate something like this into a program, I am trying to find a general algorithm. I couldn't find any existing algorithms for this, so I had a go at it myself:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gXyHm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The problem I'm having with this is that I sometimes end up with a gap in my shape, and at the third step I don't know how to find the correct vertex to start at.</p>

<p>Some ""rules"":</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The object can have any number of vertices (although realistically speaking a limit of ~20 would suffice)</p></li>
<li><p>The order of the vertices is known. This means the perimeter of the object is also known.</p></li>
<li><p>The collection of triangles after applying the algorithm should have the same area and perimeter as the piece of geometry at the beginning. (So the collection of triangles should be the same shape)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The question is: is there a known algorithm for cutting up a single, closed shape into triangles (or quads)?</strong></p>

<p>I don't know if this question is truly appropriate for the math exchange, but I hope someone here has done this before, or knows how to as I'm stuck.</p>

"<p>The two endpoints of a 1-metre long rod have an initial position at $(0,0),(0,1).$ The rod slides continuously to the position $(1,0),(0,0)$ sweeping out a region in the positive quadrant. Determine the equation for the boundary of this region.</p>

<hr>

<p>My attempt:</p>

<p>At any position, let $a$ denote the distance from the lower endpoint to the origin, $b$ the distance from the upper endpoint to the origin. Then we have
$$a^2+b^2=1,$$
$$\frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}=1.$$
I tried to fix $x$ and use the method of Lagrange multiplier to determine the maximal $y.$ But I couldn't solve the equations. Any ideas?</p>

"<p>A code snippet I need to optimize is performing something peculiar. It seems that it's somehow related to transforming from a frame of reference to another. This is what it does, in mathematical terms:</p>

<p>$ \mathfrak{q}_{prevToCurrExpMap} = \exp ( \mathfrak{q}_{PrevToCurr} ) $</p>

<p>then</p>

<p>$ \mathfrak{q}_{prevToCurrExpMap} = \mathfrak{q}_{prevToCurrExpMap} + \mathfrak{q}_{rotationInduction}$</p>

<p>and finally </p>

<p>$ \mathfrak{q}_{prevToCurr} = \ln (\mathfrak{q}_{prevToCurrExpMap} ) $</p>

<p>Essentially, the orientation quaternion's exponential map is altered by a quaternion addition, and then the result is extracted by taking the logarithm. I am trying to understand the logic behind this piece of ""code"", but nothing comes to mind.</p>

<p>Is there any obvious reason for replacing a quat $\mathfrak{q}$ with $\ln(\exp(\mathfrak{q}) + \mathfrak{p})$? (at a first glance, it does not seem to encode any kind of interpolation, but it might be trickier than it appears.)</p>

"<p>this is a bit more complicated than the post title suggests because I was running out of words. I suppose the full title would be: ""Finding the distance between the centre of an arbitrarily rotated cylinder and a point on that cylinder which is the intersection of a ray projected from the centre of the cylinder at angles a and b, which are relative to the absolute axes.""</p>

<p>To break it down a little:</p>

<p>I have a circular cylinder, which is rotated to an arbitrary orientation in 3D. I have the radius of the cylinder and I have a vector which is the vector along the cylinder's length (essentially the cylinder's orientation). The cylinder's height is infinite.</p>

<p>I also know the coordinates of the centre of the cylinder, let's call that point p. From p I draw a line in 3D in a direction specified by two angles, alpha and beta, which are angles of rotation in the cardinal axes of x and y (i.e. the absolute axes, and not relative to the cylinder). I would like to work out the point at which this line intersects the cylinder and also the distance between the two points.</p>

<p>So to break it down further:</p>

<p>1) I need to rotate the cylinder back to the origin, and then rotate the line by the exact same same angles to get them relative to the cylinder while the cylinder is at the origin.</p>

<p>2) Using this new point of reference, I need to calculate the point of intersection between the now transformed cylinder and the line made from the two transformed angles I have.</p>

<p>I can get x and y of this point by using rCosAlpha,rSinAlpha and I can get z by using rtanBeta (I have the adjacent - r (the radius) - and need the opposite)</p>

<p>And then I simply use Pythagoras' theorem to get the distance.</p>

<p>The problem is working this all out using these two frames of reference: absolute orientations and relative orientations. Or solving problem (1) so I don't have </p>

<p>Does anybody have any ideas?</p>
