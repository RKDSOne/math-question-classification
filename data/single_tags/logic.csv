"<p>An odd -- probably basic -- question about model theory:</p>

<p>For $\mathcal{M}$ a structure in a (first-order) signature $\Sigma$, let $\mathcal{M}'$ be the structure in signature $\Sigma\sqcup\lbrace U\rbrace$ -- with $U$ a unary relation -- whose reduct to $\Sigma$ is $\mathcal{M}$, and interprets $U$ as $$ U^{\mathcal{M}'}=\lbrace a: a\text{ is definable in $\mathcal{M}$}.\rbrace$$</p>

<p>Up to the choice of unary relation symbol $U$, this is well defined; moreover, we can iterate this through the ordinals: $$ \mathcal{M}^{(0)}=\mathcal{M}, \quad \mathcal{M}^{(\alpha+1)}=(\mathcal{M}^{(\alpha)})', \quad \mathcal{M}^{(\lambda)}=\bigcup_{\beta&lt;\lambda}\mathcal{M}^{(\beta)} \,\,(\lambda \text{ limit}).$$ (The union notation is technically inappropriate, but its meaning is clear.) Now, for any $\mathcal{M}$, let $$ D(\mathcal{M}, \alpha)=\lbrace a\in\mathcal{M}: a\text{ is definable in $\mathcal{M}^{(\alpha)}$}\rbrace$$ be the set of elements of $\mathcal{M}$ definable after stage $\alpha$. Let $D(\mathcal{M}, \infty)=\bigcup_{\alpha\in ON} D(\mathcal{M}, \alpha)$ be the set of all eventually definable elements, and for $a\in D(\mathcal{M}, \infty)$ let the <em>age</em> of $a$, $age_\mathcal{M}(a)$, be the least $\beta$ such that $a\in D(\mathcal{M}, \beta)$. Clearly for each $\mathcal{M}$ there is a least upper bound, $m_\mathcal{M}$, on the ages of elements of $D(\mathcal{M}, \infty)$.</p>

<p>Some very easy observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If $\mathcal{M}=(M, &lt;)$ is a well-ordering, then $D(\mathcal{M}, \infty)=M$, since the $\alpha$th element of $\mathcal{M}$ is definable by stage $\alpha$ at the latest.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if $\mathcal{M}$ is strongly minimal, $\mathcal{M}'$ need not be: consider $\mathcal{M}=\mathbb{N}+\mathbb{Z}$ as a linear order. Presumably other niceness properties such as stability are also not preserved, but I don't have examples yet.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My question is, what is known about the set $D(\mathcal{M}, \infty)$, the age function $age_\mathcal{M}$, or the invariant $m_\mathcal{M}$? I've been playing around with this idea for a bit, but my model theory is not very strong; I'm sure this has been treated before, but I haven't been able to find a reference. </p>

<p>(In case anyone is interested, I initially thought that there would be connections with notions of rank, as long as $\mathcal{M}$ is sufficiently nice; in fact, I came up with this question after using some dubious analogies to try to explain forking and rank to a friend. As far as I can tell, this initial hope is in fact bogus, but that's where this came from.)</p>

<hr>

<p>There are two other questions about this that I'm especially interested in. First, what if we augment first-order logic by adding a logical unary relation $D$ whose interpretation is stipulated to always be $D(\mathcal{M}, \infty)$ -- the resulting model theory seems wild (compactness and Lowenheim-Skolem fail extremely badly), but this logic ""comes from"" first-order logic in a natural way; is there anything nice we can say about it? Second, this time closer to computability theory: what if we replace ""definable"" with $\Sigma_1$-definable? Does $m_\mathcal{M}$ now have a recursion-theoretic interpretation? I consider these as just curiosities, compared to the main question (which, though more vague, I hope is still appropriate), but if anyone has anything to say on either count I'd be extremely interested.</p>

"<p>Hello, recently I came upon some personal notes I'd made several years ago while reviewing some basic set theory (ordinals, transfinite recursion, inaccessible cardinals etc.), and I stumbled upon a loose thread which I obviously had not resolved at the time, and which I would like to lay to rest:
Assuming some standard set theory (say ZF, even though I prefer NBG), without the Axiom of Foundation (preferably), one may define an ordinal $\alpha$ (von Neumann's definition) as a transitive set whose elements are well-ordered with respect to the membership relation $\in$. This is seen to be equivalent to the statement that $\alpha$ is transitive, all its $\beta\in\alpha$ are transitive too, and (as we cannot rely on foundation) for each non-empty $x\subseteq\alpha$ there exists some $\beta\in x$ such that $x\cap\beta=\emptyset$ (except for the last condition, this is as in Schofield's book on Mathematical Logic). One then goes on to prove that the class of all ordinals is well-ordered with respect to membership etc.; along the way a useful intermediate step is to prove that any ordinal $\alpha$ is (ad hoc definition) $\textbf{strange}$ in the sense that one has $x\in\alpha$ for any transitive $x\subsetneq\alpha$.
My question finally (as this would provide an alternate definition of ordinal sets): are elements of strange sets themselves strange, or at least transitive ?

"<p><strong>Context:</strong> Let $\Sigma=\{U,C,A,G\}$ and $L\subset\Sigma^*$, i.e. $L$ is a language over the alphabet $\Sigma$. Let $\Sigma'=\{0,1\}$ and define a homomorphism $f:\Sigma^*\to\Sigma'^*$ by extending $U \to 00$, $C \to 01$, $A \to 10$, and $G \to 11$ in the only possible way to a homomorphism. For $L':=f(L)$ we have $L=f^{-1}(L')$, because $f$ is injective. The languages $L$ and $L'$ are nearly the same for most practical purposes. However, defining a category where they are actually isomorphic is challenging, because $f^{-1}$ is only a partial function. Nailing down the notion of a partial homomorphism between monoids seems like a reasonable first step.</p>

<hr>

<p>A homomorphism $h:M_0\to M'_0$ between two monoids with zero $M_0$ and $M'_0$ is a monoid-homomorphism between $M_0$ and $M'_0$, which maps the zero of $M_0$ to the zero of $M'_0$.</p>

<p>(1) One idea to define partial homomorphisms between two monoids $M$ and $M'$ is to adjoint zeros to $M$ and $M'$ to get monoids with zero $M_0$ and $M'_0$, and define that the partial homomorphisms between $M$ and $M'$ are the restrictions of the homomorphisms between $M_0$ and $M'_0$.</p>

<p>(2) Another idea is that a partial homomorphisms $p:M\to M'$ is a partial function $p$ which satisfies</p>

<ol>
<li>$p(1)=1'$.</li>
<li>If $p(x)=x'$ and $p(y)=y'$, then $p(xy)=x'y'$.</li>
</ol>

<p>A partial homomorphism according to (1) satisfies the conditions (2), and additionally satisfies</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>If $x\notin\operatorname{dom}(p)$ and $y\in M$, then $xy\notin\operatorname{dom}(p)$ and $yx\notin\operatorname{dom}(p)$.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conditions 1, 2, and 3 together should be equivalent to definition (1). If not, please correct me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always favored definition (1), because then a partial homomorphism would be uniquely determined by its values on a generating set. And for a <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/a/123617"">quite natural definition of partial monoids</a>, the category of partial monoids and partial homomorphisms is equivalent to the category of monoids with zero, if definition (1) is extended appropriately to partial monoids.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Context continued</strong> Sadly, $f^{-1}$ is only a partial homomorphism according to definition (2), but fails to satisfy definition (1). This is sad, because the set of partial homomorphisms from $\Sigma^*$ to $\Sigma'^*$ according to definition (1) is easy to describe. For definition (2) it is not even clear whether $\operatorname{dom}(p)$ will always be computationally enumerable, let alone having any chance to computationally enumerate the set of partial homomorphisms itself. But maybe the partial isomorphisms are better behaved, so using definition (2) could still make sense.</p>

<hr>

<p>A further test for definitions (1) and (2) is to generalize them to define when a relation $R\subset M\times M'$ is a morphism between $M$ and $M'$. Now (1) no longer makes sense, but conditions 1, 2, and 3 still make sense and become</p>

<ol>
<li>$1\ R\ 1'$.</li>
<li>If $x\ R\ x'$ and $y\ R\ y'$, then $xy\ R\ x'y'$.</li>
<li>If $x\notin\operatorname{dom}(R)$ and $y\in M$, then $xy\notin\operatorname{dom}(R)$ and $yx\notin\operatorname{dom}(R)$.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Some authors require $\operatorname{dom}(R)=M$ for relational morphisms instead of condition 3. Thus nothing is said about partial homomorphisms, and the useful asymmetry between source and target is maintained.)</p>

<p>Condition 3 feels unnatural to me in this context, because it seems unable to ensure that a morphism is uniquely determined by its behavior on a generating set. But at least $\operatorname{dom}(R)$ would still be determined by its intersection with a generating set, so even this test is not fully conclusive.</p>

"<p>Inspired by this <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/q/390560/33495"">question</a> on MSE I tried to prove the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $T$ be a complete theory in a first order language and $\kappa$ a cardinal. If $T$ is $\kappa$-stable, then there exists a $\kappa$-saturated model $\mathcal M$ of $T$ such that there is some sequence of indiscernibles $(a_i)_{i&lt;\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ an ordinal of size less than $\kappa$, such that $\langle (a_i)_{i&lt;\gamma}\rangle^{\mathcal M}=\mathcal M$, where $\langle (a_i)_{i&lt;\gamma}\rangle^{\mathcal M}$ is the Skolem hull of $(a_i)_{i&lt;\gamma}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the following argument shows this holds provided $\kappa$ is regular:</p>

<p>By induction on $\alpha$, let us construct for each $\alpha&lt;\kappa$ a model $\mathcal M_{\alpha}$ of $T$ of size $\kappa$ and a sequence of indiscernibles $I_{\alpha}\subseteq M_{\alpha}$ whose order-type is an ordinal less than $\kappa^+$, and for given $\alpha&lt;\beta$, $\mathcal M_{\alpha}\prec \mathcal M_{\beta}$, $I_{\alpha}\subseteq I_{\beta}$ and each element of $I_{\beta}\setminus I_{\alpha}$ greater than all elements of $I_{\alpha}$ (1).</p>

<p>Let $\mathcal M$ be a model of $T$, and consider $I_0=\{a_{\alpha}:\alpha&lt;\kappa\}$ an enumeration of $\mathcal M$, then using the compactness theorem and Ramsey's theorem we get $\mathcal M_0$ a model of $T$ of size $\kappa$ containing $\mathcal M$ with a sequence $I_0'$ of indiscernibles of order type $\kappa$ which realizes $EM(I_0)$, WLOG we may assume $I_0=I_0'$.</p>

<p>For $\alpha$ limit we simply put $\mathcal M_{\alpha}=\bigcup_{\beta&lt;\alpha}\mathcal M_{\beta}$ and let $I_{\alpha}$ be the concatenation of the $I_{\beta}'$s $(\beta&lt;\alpha)$.</p>

<p>Now suppose $\alpha$ is not limit. </p>

<p>If $\alpha$ is an even ordinal , let $I_{\alpha}=\{a_{\gamma}:\gamma&lt;\mu\}$, where $(a_{\gamma})_{\gamma&lt;\mu}$ is an enumeration of $\mathcal M_{\alpha-1}$ such that for any $\beta&lt;\alpha$ we have that $I_{\beta}$ is bounded in $I_{\alpha}$, $\mu&lt;\kappa^+$, let $\mathcal M_{\alpha}$ be an elementary extension of $\mathcal M_{\alpha-1}$ of size $\kappa$ that realizes $EM(I_{\alpha})$.</p>

<p>If $\alpha$ is an odd ordinal let $\mathcal M_{\alpha}$ be a model of $T$ of size $\kappa$ realizing all types over subsets of $I_{\alpha-1}$ of size less than $\kappa$ in $\mathcal M_{\alpha-1}$, then let $I_{\alpha}$ be the union of all the previous $I_{\beta}'$s and the set of all this realizations, with such a enumeration satisfying (1); $|I_{\alpha}|=\kappa$ as $T$ is $\kappa$-stable.</p>

<p>When we finish at step $\kappa$, let $I$ be the concatenation of all the $I_{\alpha}'$s and put $\mathcal N=\bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\kappa}\mathcal M_{\alpha}$, then by the construction we have that $I$ is a sequence of indiscernibles in $\mathcal N$ of order type less than $\kappa^+$, $\langle I\rangle^{\mathcal N}=\mathcal N$, and thus $\mathcal N$ is $\kappa$-saturated because of the construction.</p>

<p>This solves the MSE question for $\kappa$ regular, as elementary equivalent saturated structures of the same size are isomorphic, and the above model has $2^{\kappa}$ automorphisms.</p>

<p>My question is, can we construct such model for $\kappa$ singular, under the above hypothesis?</p>

are transitive models of ZFC and $G$ is $M$-generic for the
forcing to add a Cohen subset to some cardinal $\kappa$, that is, using $\text{Add}(\kappa,1)^M$, and $H$
is similarly $N$-generic to add a Cohen subset to some other cardinal
$\delta$, using $\text{Add}(\delta,1)^N$?</p>

the extension $M[c]$; could it be that this model might also be
realized as $N[A]$ for some other ground model $N$, where $A$ is
an $N$-generic Cohen subset of $\omega_1^N$? Note that $M\neq N$
since it must be that $c\in N$ as the higher forcing does not add
reals. For my application, I need to understand the case where the two cardinals are both inaccessible cardinals (if not much more). Also, it is not difficult to identify general situations where this kind of thing is impossible. What I really want to know is if it can ever happen at all.</p>

Or this is trivially incorrect “conjecture”? It seems that this does not contradict to Godel Theorem, which consider one theory, not a sequence of theories.</p>

<p>Another way of thinking about the same idea is to take only axioms from ZFC but add a new derivation rule, which would say that ""from any set of axioms A it follows that A is consistent"". With this derivation rule we would derive Cons(ZFC) in one step! So, for some reasons (by the way, I do not understand why) Godel theorem is not applicable here. May we hope that with ZFC extended with such a new derivation rule we can, say, solve all Diophantine equations? </p>

At time $t=0$ a visitor tells the islanders that at least one of them has blue eyes. All of the above is common knowledge among the islanders.</p>

<p>Certainly, if initially only a finite number of islanders have blue eyes, then after a finite time everyone will know his color.

Unfortunately, that gets us nothing because I think this fact was already common knowledge at time $t=0$.

<p>If yes, can anyone provide a reference where I can find this result?<br>
If no, can you provide a counterexample?</p>

<p>EDIT: Adding clarification of where this comes from.</p>

<p>Denote by P the property in question. A slightly stronger property P' requires all the formulas in the proof to also not exceed N propositional variables, where N is the maximum between the number of variables in the non-iterative axiom and the number of variables in the non-iterative theorem to prove. So basically we are trying to prove a theorem without increasing the modal degree nor the number of propositional variables during the proof (with a possible exception for PC formulas; for example one may use $p \rightarrow p \lor q$ to infer that $\square p \rightarrow \square p \lor \lozenge p$ and this would not count as an increase in the number of variables).</p>

<p>It looks like for a system defined by a combination of iterative and non-iterative axioms these properties do not hold (universally). For example, see Hughes and Cresswell pp 58, in order to prove $\square p\rightarrow \square \square p$ in S5, one must use formulas of modal degree 3 during the proof. The same thing appears to be the case when proving that T+B+S4 implies S5. I also suspect that increasing the number of variables does not help in avoiding the increase in modal degree in these cases, therefore the distinction between P and P'. </p>

<p>However, P and even P' seem to hold for non-iterative systems. Given that these systems are relatively simple (i.e. they have FMP and a number of other ""nice"" properties), I was thinking that P and/or P' may be known results, but I cannot find them.</p>

<p>According to user14111, the notion of a Moschovakis cardinal arose in an unpublished manuscript circulated around the late 60s; given the timing, my current guess is that ""Moschovakis cardinal"" is just a synonym for ""Reinhardt cardinal,"" but I'll admit there is no real basis for my guess.</p>

"<p>The reals are the unique complete ordered field. The hyperreals $\mathbb{R}^\*$ are not unique in ZFC, and many people seemed to think this was a serious objection to them. Abraham Robinson responded that this was because ZFC was tuned up to guarantee the uniqueness of the reals. Ehrlich wrote a long paper in 2012 (ref and link below), which I've only skimmed so far. It's mainly about the surreals $\textbf{No}$, not the hyperreals, but it seems to suggest that Robinson's idea has been carried forward successfully by people like Keisler and Ehrlich. Apparently NBG set theory has some properties that are better suited to this sort of thing than those of ZFC.</p>

<p>Section 9 of the Ehrlich paper discusses the relationship between $\mathbb{R}^\*$ and $\textbf{No}$ within NBG. He presents Keisler's axioms for the hyperreals, which basically say that they're a proper extension of the reals, the transfer principle holds, and they're saturated. At the end of the section, he states a theorem: ""In NBG there is ... a unique structure $\langle\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}^\*,*\rangle$ such that [Keisler's axioms] are satisfied and for which $\mathbb{R}^\*$ is a proper class; moreover, in such a structure $\mathbb{R}^\*$ is isomorphic to $\textbf{No}$.""</p>

<p>My question is: Does this result indicate that Robinson's program has been completed successfully and in a way that would satisfy mathematicians in general that the nonuniqueness of the hyperreals is no longer an argument against NSA? It seems to me that this would depend on the consensus about NBG: whether NBG is expected to be consistent; whether it is a natural way of doing set theory with proper classes; and whether a result such as Ehrlich's theorem is likely to be true for any set theory with proper classes, or whether such results are likely to be true only because of some specific properties of NBG (in which case the nonuniqueness has only been made into a new kind of nonuniqueness). Since I know almost nothing about NBG, I don't know the answers to these questions.</p>

<p>One thing that confuses me here is that I thought the surreals lacked the transfer principle, so, e.g., where the hyperreals automatically inherit $\mathbb{Z}^\*$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ as an internal set, a specific effort has to be made to define the omnific integers $\textbf{Oz}$ as a subclass of $\textbf{No}$, and $\textbf{Oz}$ doesn't necessarily have the same properties as $\mathbb{Z}$ with respect to, e.g., induction and prime factorization (see <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/72691/can-we-axiomatize-omnific-integers-without-the-surreal-number-system"">Can we axiomatize Omnific Integers without the Surreal Number system?</a> ). Would the idea be that according to Ehrlich's result, $\mathbb{Z}^\*$ would be (isomorphic to) a subclass of $\textbf{Oz}$?</p>

Furthermore, following lemmas 18.7 and 18.8 of Jech, if $\alpha$ is an <i> <strike>infinite </strike> infinite limit</i> ordinal, an increasing map from alpha to beta gives an elementary embedding from $L_{i_\alpha}$ to $L_{i_\beta}$, where $i_\alpha$ is the $\alpha$-th indiscernible. This is because $L_{i_\alpha}$ equals the Skolem hull in itself of the first $\alpha$ indiscernibles. However, I am not clear on the following points.</p>

<p>1) Is it the case that for a <i><strike>finite</strike> successor</i> ordinal, n, $L_{i_n}$ is necessarily equal to the Skolem hull in $L_{i_n}$ of the first n indiscernibles? Jech only proves this result for infinite ordinals. </p>

<p>2) Is it possible that there could be an elementary embedding from $L$ to $L$, or from $L_{i_\alpha}$ to $L_{i_\beta}$ ($\alpha, \beta$ may be finite or infinite), that does not always map indiscernibles to indiscernibles? 
This sounds weird, but I'm not convinced it's impossible. As far as I know, there's no formula in $L$ that defines ""$\alpha$ is a Silver indiscernible."" (In fact there is no such formula -- see Andreas Blass's comment below.)</p>

"<p>Was ""arithmetical translation"" (that is, coding in the Goedel sense) ever a part of Hilbert's Program?  I ask this question for several reasons:</p>

<p>i) it gives the numerals |, ||, |||,.... an ersatz 'meaning' in themselves  and Hilbert (at least in his paper ""On the Infinite"") states that ""These numerals, which are the object of our consideration, have no meaning at all in themselves.""</p>

<p>ii) inasmuch as a formal first-order theory $T$ (containing enough arithmetic for Goedel numbering) was to be treated as a 'formula game' of 'meaningless symbols' for the purpose obtaining a finitary consistency proof of $T$, ""arithmetical translation"" of $T$ into itself gives these 'meaningless formulae' meaning, which produces self-reference (assuming $T$ proves multiplication to be total, following Dan Willard's results regarding self-verifying formal theories) which, assuming $T$ proves multiplication to be total, derives the incompleteness theorems.  But then, what was the purpose of Hilbert requiring the formulae of $T$ to be 'meaningless'?  Wasn't it the purpose of actually having a finitary proof of the consistency of $T$ (meaning that treating the formulae of $T$ as meaningless strings of symbols may allow one to avoid, say, the use of primitive recursive functionals of finite type to prove the consistency of $T$, as Goedel does for $PA$)?</p>

<p>iii) Consider also the following statement of Bernays from his survey article from 1935, ""Hilbert's investigations on the foundations of arithmetic"" (Bernays project:  Text no. 14, translation by Dirk Schlimm, which can be found under title <a href=""http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/bernays/Pdf/untersuchungen.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">on the web</a>) regarding Goedel's incompleteness theorems:</p>

<p>""The theorem mentioned [that is, the one that decides ""whether it is possible to provide a proof for the consistency of number the theoretic formalism with elementary combinatorial methods in the sense of the 'finite standpoint' ""]  is one of the different important results of Goedels' paper [""On Formally Undecidable propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I], which has brought fundamental enlightenment with regards to the relation between contentfulness and formalism--whose investigation has been mentioned by Hilbert in ""Axiomatisches Denken"" as one of the aims of proof theory.</p>

<p>The basic message of the theorem is that a proof for the consistency of a consistent formalism, which encompasses the usual logical calculus and number theory, cannot be represented in this formalism itself, more precisely:  it is not possible to deduce the elementary arithmetical theorem which represents the claim of the consistency of the formalism--based on a certain kind of enumeration of the symbols and variables and an enumeration of the formulas and of the finite series of formulas derivated from it--in the formalism itself.      </p>

<p>To be sure, nothing is said hereby directly about the possibility of finite consistency proofs; but a criterion follows, which every proof of the consistency for a formalism of number theory or a more comprehensive formalism has to meet:  a consideration must occur in the proof which can not be represented--based on the arithmetical translation--in the formalism mentioned.""</p>

<p>If anyone can provide a cite from any of Hilbert's writings, letters, etc. stating that arithmetization (or any other form of coding) of some first-order theory $T$ in itself was a part of his program, I would be very grateful.  Thanks in advance for your help. </p>

<p>The proof of the Gödel's first incompleteness theorem, that I know is:
Gödel numbers by $n$ the statements $E_n(i)$ with one argument $i$.
""$E_i(i)$ is not provable"" is a statement $A(i)$. There is an $n$ such that $A$ is $E_n$. The proof of the theorem says: if $A(n)$ is not $\mathit{true}$, $E_n(n)$ is provable. So $A(n)$ is provable, and $A(n)$ is $\mathit{true}$, contradiction. So $A(n)$ is $\mathit{true}$, and not provable.</p>

<p>If $n$ is the Gödel's number of a statement $Q_n$ (without argument), and if $P(n)$ is the statement saying that $Q_n$ is provable in the formal system of Peano's axioms, we add, for every $n$, the axiom: ""$P(n) \implies Q_n$"".</p>

<p>Note that I don't quite have the result that $X$ is a choice object (equivalently, classically well-orderable). I'm not demanding the existence of sections for arbitrary surjections, or more generally for total relation into $X$ (a fine distinction, I'm sure). </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> $X$ being a choice object is equivalent to saying that there is a choice function from the set $P_+X$ of inhabited subsets to $X$. I am only asking for a choice function on the subset of $P_+X$ given by those subsets of $X$ of strictly smaller cardinality, call it $P^{\lt X}_+X$.</p>

I decide to ask another question, because mathoverflow is not projected to be good environment for discussion, so it would be better to ask another question than to modify previous one.</p>

<p>From wikipedia, we have definition of <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_%2528algebra%2529"" rel=""nofollow"">magma</a></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""In abstract algebra, a magma (or
  groupoid; not to be confused with
  groupoids  in category theory) is a
  basic kind of algebraic structure.
  Specifically, a magma consists of a
  set M equipped with a single binary
  operation M × M → M. A binary
  operation is closed by definition, but
  no other axioms are imposed on the
  operation.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Axioms of magma structure are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic"" rel=""nofollow"">first order theory</a>. So lets drop words ""set"" and ""closed"" from the definition, and try playing with theory T for which we have:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>predefined single object E</p></li>
<li><p>objects which may be whatever You<br>
like to name by letters from
finite alphabet ( not necessary elements of defined set)</p></li>
<li><p>binary operation defined that for
every pair of objects it sends it into predefined element E. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>It has interpretation on the ground of ZFC and then it has finite or infinite models which are sets - in fact it may be considered as trivial magma if we assume that objects are from set $M U \{E\}$.   Whilst considered without set background it should also work, and do not be cursed by any obvious paradoxes ( because it has set-models). Then we have an example of theory which, when interpreted in domain of sets, is first order theory and is consistent / has models. </p>

<p>Suppose we <strong>formally</strong> drop requirement that domain of discourse for this theory is set interpretation. So then several questions arises:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Is theory T first order theory?</strong> When interpreted on set domain, it is. But if not in set domain?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it  necessary to interpret it in
set universum, by means of any other arguments than arising from question 1*?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we say that T is consistent in domain of set theory ( whilst we do not know in other domains)?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If we drop requirements that universum of objects is in set, will
this theory becomes inconsistent?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Is for any theory obligatory to point
its domain of discourse  in  a formal
meaning, that is for pure
syntactical definition? Is interpretation necessary?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>By consistent I presume definition that """"Consistent"" means that a contradiction cannot be deduced from it.""</strong> </p>

<p>Suppose that answer on 4th question is NO, we may say that theory is still consistent even if we drop requirement that it is interpreted on domain of sets. Then we will end with theory which has set-model. From completeness theorem when interpreted on domain of set is consistent, and even if we drop certain domain interpretation we will still have consistent theory of first order with model from sets universum, but also with models outside of it. Suppose that we get our objects from some big category. I believe that it does not changes nothing, does it? Then there are theories for which we have models which are not sets ( whilst to be consistent it still have to have models which are sets!). </p>

<p>Is there any obvious mistake in this hand-waving of mine? </p>

<p>From Wikipedia article about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic"" rel=""nofollow"">First Order Logic</a> I know that ""<em>he definition above requires that the domain of discourse of any interpretation must be a nonempty set.</em>"" but it is a remark pointing to ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_domain"" rel=""nofollow"">empty domains</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_logic"" rel=""nofollow"">free logic</a>"" which obviously are not in case here. The only interesting link is this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_%2528model_theory%2529"" rel=""nofollow"">Interpretation_(model theory)</a> but it still is related to set or empty domain interpretations. But from category theory it seems to be possible to have theories which are interpreted in larger domains that sets in consistent way. </p>

<p>I would like to mention other questions in this or similar area here on mathoverflow, but I would like to say that I am not interested in category theory by other means than just an example of theory which is has other domain of interpretation than set.:

"<p>Recall that with the internal language of 1-toposes, we have the nice, basic, and useful result that geometric sequents are stable under base change along geometric morphisms: If $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are geometric formulas (formulas not containing $\forall$ and $\Rightarrow$), and if $\mathcal{E} \models \forall x:X.

<p><strong>(1)</strong> One can represent <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/196619/a-specific-model-of-zfc"">Hamkins and Lowe question</a> based on this notion that is: Is there any model of $ZFC$, $V$ such that $TH(V,\in)=Th(V,\mathcal{C})$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is the class of all forcing notions that collapse a cardinal onto $\omega$?

<p><strong>(3)</strong> We say two classes $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ of forcing notions are equivalent over $V$ respect to theorems, if $Th(V,\mathcal{P})=Th(V,\mathcal{Q})$. This gives us a mean to compare forcing notions.</p>

"<p>It is well-known that both Presburger arithmetic (by contrast with Peano arithmetic) and Tarski geometry are decidable. I was in the shower this morning and wondered whether there exists an elegant mutual generalisation of these theories that is also decidable. In particular, I settled on the following system:</p>

<ul>
<li>The objects are the finite-dimensional affine subspaces of your favourite infinite-dimensional real Hilbert space (let's say $L^2$ for concreteness).</li>
<li>We have a binary predicate, $x \subseteq y$, which inherits its usual meaning.</li>
<li>We have a ternary predicate, $I(x, y; z)$, which means there is an isometry of the ambient space which fixes $z$ and maps $x$ bijectively onto $y$.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll show that this does indeed generalise both Presburger arithmetic and Tarski geometry.</p>

<hr>

<p>Firstly, note that we can encode the concept of a point:</p>

<p>$$ x \textrm{ is a point } \iff \forall y . (y \subseteq x) \implies (y = x) $$</p>

<p>(It's rather cute that this is precisely how Euclid described a point, namely 'a point is that which has no part'.)</p>

<p>Similarly for lines:</p>

<p>$$ x \textrm{ is a line } \iff x \textrm{ is not a point and } \forall y . (y \subseteq x) \implies ((y = x) \textrm{ or } y \textrm{ is a point}) $$</p>

<p>We can continue inductively to define planes and so on.</p>

<p>We describe two lines $x, y$ as <em>parallel</em> if there is a plane which contains both $x$ and $y$, and there is no $z$ such that $z \subseteq x$ and $z \subseteq y$. This allows one to define \emph{parallelogram}, and emulate vector addition with respect to some origin $o$. That allows one to take Minkowski sums of affine subspaces with respect to $o$.</p>

<hr>

<p>So far we haven't touched the ternary predicate $I(x, y; z)$. One rudimentary application is to equate distances between points:</p>

<p>$$ |a - b| = |d - c| \iff \exists e . (b + c = a + e) \textrm{ and } I(d, e; c) $$</p>

<p>Here we're using $(b + c = a + e)$ as shorthand for $e$ being a point and satisfying the vector addition property mentioned earlier. We can also compare distances: $|x - y| \geq |a - b|$ if and only if we can find points $c, d$ such that $b + b = c + d$ and $|x - y| = |a - c| = |a - d|$. Together with collinearity, this allows us to define Tarski's 'betweenness' predicate, so we can encode all of Tarskian geometry.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another application of this predicate is to equate dimension:</p>

<p>$$ \dim(x) = \dim(y) \iff \exists z . I(x, y; z) $$</p>

<p>We can also add dimensions. Specifically, $\dim(x) + \dim(y) = \dim(z)$ if and only if we can find a point $o$ and spaces $a, b$ such that $\dim(a) = \dim(x)$, $\dim(b) = \dim(y)$, the intersection of $a$ and $b$ is $o$, and every point in $z$ can be expressed uniquely as a sum (as vectors relative to $o$) of a point in $a$ and a point in $b$.</p>

<p>This endows us with the ability to perform Presburger arithmetic on the dimensions of spaces.</p>

<hr>

<p>Anyway, this prompts the question: is this theory (together with a suitable finite set of axioms) decidable? With 'bounded quantifiers' (i.e. bounded dimension), this reduces to $n$-dimensional Tarski geometry (and therefore is decidable). However, I feel this theory is much stronger since you can make first-order statements about arbitrary finite-dimensional vector spaces.</p>

<p>I have an injective map $i:V\to W$ which induces a corresponding embedding $i:{\bf P}(V)\to{\bf P}(W)$ between formulas. My question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong> is it true that $\Gamma$ consistent $\ \Rightarrow\ $ $i(\Gamma)$ consistent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When $V$ is an infinite set I know what to do: I can carry back any proof underlying the sequent $i(\Gamma)\vdash\bot$ into a proof of $\Gamma\vdash\bot$ by substituting variables from $W$ to $V$ while avoiding capture. The problem arises when $V$ is a finite set. I can no longer be sure I can carry back proofs while avoiding capture. I am looking for a reference where this question may have been dealt with, or any hints on how to approach the problem. More generally, this question can be phrased as follows: given $\phi\in{\bf P}(V)$ with $V$ finite, I want to show the implication $\vdash i(\phi)\ \Rightarrow\ \vdash\phi$. Heuristically, if $\phi\in{\bf P}(V)$ can be proved with variables in $W\supseteq V$, then it can also be proved with variables in $V$. This question is motivated by Gödel's completeness theorem which I am attempting to prove on ${\bf P}(V)$ for $V$ finite, following a Henkin type proof: as I add new variables to the language, I need to make sure consistency is preserved, i.e. that I have a conservative extension.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Following Andreas' and Noah's answer, I have hopefully made the question clearer.</p>

<p><strong>LAST EDIT</strong>: I have been stuck on this for a few weeks now. However, I am very hopeful the following strategy will work: first, spell out the details of an <strong>LK</strong> Gentzen type system in this particular setting ($V$ possibly finite, $[y/x]$ essential rather than just avoiding capture) which is equivalent to the Hilbert system. Then for all $i:V\to W$ injective, show the implication $i(\Gamma)\vdash i(\Delta)$ provable without cut $\Rightarrow$ $\Gamma\vdash\Delta$ provable without cut. Finally show that cut elimination holds in this setting. Proofs of the cut elimination theorem (e.g. Takeuti) seem to rely on an infinite supply of variables. However, if I am right about the implication $\Rightarrow$, I can always embed a sequent in a larger space to eliminate cut and bring it back to the smaller space. Comments and suggestions are very welcome.   </p>

"<p>Thank everybody for answering my previous questions: <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/15685/is-it-necessary-that-model-of-theory-is-a-set"">first</a>, and <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/15812/theory-interpreted-in-non-set-domain-of-discourse-may-be-consistent"">second</a>.</p>

<p>Here I would like to ask about some important thing which I do not understand clearly. </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Is it necessary for theory to have given interpretation in some
universe by definition or not, it is not necessary for set of axiom to be a theory?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The meaning of question above is: is this a <strong>correct</strong> way of defining theory if we do not give domain of interpretation for it? What obstacles may arise from that? <strong>For example</strong>: As far as I know standard category theory do not qualify clearly which is its domain of interpretation, then, may we say that it is ""defined theory"" from a formal point of view? I have heard that there are some efforts to define category theory by means of metacategories which probably has as one of its aims to give clear definition of domain of interpretation. </p>

<p>So there another question arises for which I will try to give some introduction by example.</p>

<p>I may think about theory which when interpreted in set universe defined by some formulas, relations whatever may be consistent and have models, whilst in other universes do not. Is this a case? For example in answer about possible definition of domain of discourse for first order theories <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/15812/theory-interpreted-in-non-set-domain-of-discourse-may-be-consistent/15813#15813"">here</a> Joel David Hamkins wrote: ""If V is the universe of all sets, we can define certain classes in V, such as { x | φ(x) }, where φ is any property."" </p>

<p>What if $\phi(x)$ is not property from first order logic? </p>

<p>For example we may consider sentence $S= \{x | \phi (x) \}$ as meaning:""for every theory x when schema of axioms of induction is present in axiom set"". It is clearly not first order sequence, so maybe model which is interpreted in such universe is not first order model even if axiom of theory forms first order set? The only difference here is in a way we introduce a domain of interpretation so maybe this level of freedom is too much? </p>

<p>Usual definition of domain of interpretation which I have found in wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_%2528mathematical_logic%2529"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> uses set ""structure"" but not state clearly that domain of discourse has to be first order set from the beginning! It is something which is not clear for me here. Should I believe that some ""interpretations"" of theory may be inconsistent whilst other may be consistent when we drop interpretation part as a definition and we leave it free?</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>If we construct theory in first order logic ( for example as in my <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/15812/theory-interpreted-in-non-set-domain-of-discourse-may-be-consistent"">second question</a>), and then we will try to use it on domain of objects defined by means of higher order logic, do we end with higher order theory, or rather first order theory which is saying something about second order logic objects?</strong> Or maybe the answer is"" ""it depends"" and there should be stated additional requirements?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have hope it is no obviously wrong question...</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note 1.</strong>  As I do not want to be found very speculative, I will point to blog of Terence Tao <a href=""http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/08/27/printer-friendly-css-and-nonfirstorderizability/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> where You may find some information about nonfirstorderisability and specially this sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>which is part of the fundamental
  theorem of linear algebra, does not
  seem to be expressible as stated in
  first order set theory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there are pretty useful practical statement, not very abstract, in normal mathematics which cannot be expressed in first order theory language.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note 2.</strong> In wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse-Kelley_set_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> I found the following remark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""MK can be confused with second-order
  ZFC, ZFC with second-order logic
  (representing second-order objects in
  set rather than predicate language) as
  its background logic. The language of
  second-order ZFC is similar to that of
  MK (although a set and a class having
  the same extension can no longer be
  identified), and their syntactical
  resources for practical proof are
  almost identical (and are identical if
  MK includes the strong form of
  Limitation of Size). But the semantics
  of second-order ZFC are quite
  different from those of MK. For
  example, if MK is consistent then it
  has a countable first-order model,
  while second-order ZFC has no
  countable models.""</p>

<p>In first order logic, the rule of universal introduction says that if $\Sigma\vdash\phi\left[t\right]$ then $\Sigma\vdash\forall x\phi\left[x/t\right]$, where $\Sigma$ is a set of axioms, $\phi$ is any formula that has $x$ as the only free variable and $t$ is any term. There is one restriction: $t$ cannot appear in $\Sigma$.</p>

<p>The problem is that, in set theory, every instance of the axiom of specification belong to $\Sigma$; in particular, instances of the axiom of specification in which a term appears belong to $\Sigma$. So every term appears in $\Sigma$, and you cannot use the rule of universal introduction at all. Without that rule, no relevant proof can be written down as far as I know.</p>

$M^{*} = M$ and $M'' = M$.   </p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_von_Neumann_algebra"">abelian von Neumann algebras</a> are exactly the algebras $L^{\infty}(X)$ with $(X, \mu)$ a standard measure space. They are isomorphic to one of the following: </p>

<p><strong>Noncommutative philosophy</strong>: There are various <em>schools</em> of noncommutative philosophy, here is the <em>school</em> close to operator algebras. This issue is not about philosophy, so I will explain it quickly (for more details see <em>for example</em> the introduction of this <a href=""http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/book94bigpdf.pdf"">book</a>). First an intuitive idea : in the same way as there are <em>classical physics</em> and  <em>quantum physics</em>, there are <em>classical mathematics</em> and <em>quantum mathematics</em>. What does it mean in practice ? It means the following : in the <em>classical mathematics</em> there are many different structures, <em>for example</em>, the measurable, topological or Riemannian spaces. The point is to encode each structure by using the framework of commutative operator algebras. For the previous examples, it's the commutative von Neumann algebras, C$^{*}$-algebras and spectral triples. Now if we take these operator algebraic structures and if we remove the <em>commutativity</em>, we obtain what we call <em>noncommutative analogues</em> : <strong>noncommutative measurable, topological or Riemannian spaces</strong>.<br>
<em>This school</em> explores noncommutative analogues of more and more structured objects, it goes in one direction. My point is to question about the other direction (back to the <em>Source</em>) :<br>
What's the noncommutative analogue of a set (called a <strong>noncommutative set</strong>) ?    </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is a <em>noncommutative set</em>? </p>

<p>The von Neumann algebras of the standard measure space $[0,1]$, $[0,1]\cup \{1,2,...,n \}$ and $[0,1]\cup \mathbb{N}$ are not isomorphic, but as sets, these spaces are isomorphic (i.e., same cardinal).  </p>

<p>Is there a natural equivalence relation $\sim$ on the von Neumann algebras, forgetting the <em>measure space</em> but remembering the <em>set space</em>, on abelian von Neumann algebras?  </p>

<p><strong>Remark</strong>: If $M \sim N$, we could say that they are isomorphic as <strong>noncommutative sets</strong>.<br>
The equivalence class could be called the <strong>quantum cardinal</strong> (a link with <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/133050/the-cyclic-subfactors-theory-a-quantum-arithmetic"">cyclic subfactor</a> theory?).</p>

"<p>[I have updated the question after initial comments in the hope of clarifying it.]</p>

<p>I do quite a bit of reasoning, typically about topology and metric spaces, in ""non-standard"" foundations, such as inside of a particular topos, in type theory, or a predicative constructive setting. These typically do not have anything corresponding to unbounded separation or replacement (the constructive set theory CZF does have collection, though).</p>

<p>I have a pretty good feel when restricted forms of excluded middle and choice are needed, and what things powersets give us over predicative math, etc. But I never ever wish I had unbounded separation and replacement. Why is that? Is it just because of the kind of math I do, or are these two really not needed very much in ordinary math?</p>

<p>To make the question more specific: <em>what are some well-known definitions and theorems in ""ordinary"" mathematics which require unbounded separation or replacement?</em></p>

<p>The obvious uses of replacement and unbounded separation come from set theory, so we should avoid listing those. Ideally, I am looking for theorems and definitions in algebra, topology, and analysis.</p>

<p>Here is a non example from order theory, which was suggested in the comments. Under the usual encoding of ordinals as hereditarily transitive transitive sets, the rank of the function $n \mapsto \omega + n$ is $\omega + \omega$ and so we need replacement to show its existence. However, even PA can speak about this sort of small countable ordinals, so we are seeing here an artifact of a particular encoding. A different encoding of countable ordinals would make this function easy to define (for example we could view the countable ordinals as orders of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$).</p>

<p>The only example of unbounded separation I can think of right now comes from category theory. In a large category $C$ the definition of epi is unbounded, as it requires quantification over all objects of $C$. I am looking for something that is not so directly linked to a question of size.</p>

"<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Let $\kappa$ be an $\aleph$ cardinal, we say that $\langle f_\alpha\colon\alpha\to\kappa\mid\alpha&lt;\kappa^+\rangle$ is a <em>ladder</em> if every $f_\alpha$ is injective.</p>

<p>Equivalently this is the range of a choice function from every injection of $\alpha$ into $|\alpha|$ (for $\alpha&lt;\kappa$ we can always assume the identity is taken). Such ladder implies automatically that $\kappa^+$ is regular, since the union of $\kappa$ enumerated sets of size $\kappa$ is at most of size $\kappa$. (Recall that for well ordered sets $\kappa\times\kappa=\kappa$ even without the axiom of choice)</p>

<p>For example, then, if $\omega_1$ is singular then there is no such ladder of countable ordinals, since this would imply that $\aleph_1=\aleph_0^+$ is regular, therefore the existence of ladders for every successor ordinal is not provable in ZF alone.</p>

<p>However if we assume the existence of an inaccessible cardinal we can have the situation where $\aleph_1$ is indeed regular but there is no ladder avail. Indeed this is a necessary requirement since in such situation $\omega_1$ is inaccessible in $L$.</p>

<p>Both the forcing which makes $\aleph_1$ singular and the one which makes it regular without a ladder are essentially the same: collapse a limit cardinal to $\aleph_1$ and take symmetry model which ensures that no ladder exists, while setting $\aleph_1$ to have the cofinality of collapsed cardinal, i.e. singular or regular (if it was inaccessible).</p>

<p><strong>Question I:</strong> Can we do this trick by replacing $\aleph_1$ by $\aleph_\alpha$ for any non-limit ordinal? So for example, $\aleph_5$ would be singular or regular without a ladder.</p>

<p><strong>Question II:</strong> We do not need an inaccessible cardinal to have $\omega_1$ singular, nor $\omega_2$ singular. However if we want them <em>both</em> to be singular it already implies $0^\\#$ exists, and requires Woodin cardinals.</p>

<p>Suppose $\aleph_1$ and $\aleph_2$ are both regular, and neither has a ladder. Can we do that ""just"" from the existence of two inaccessible cardinals, or would such phenomenon imply that some very large cardinals are playing in the background?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In logic, quantification is the
  binding of a variable ranging over a
  domain of discourse</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Is there any formal ""definition"" of universal quantifier for example using definition of domain of discourse?</strong> </p>

<p>I mean a formula build without universal quantifier, and existential one which has the same meaning if referenced to defined domain of discourse?</p>

<p>For example:
Suppose we use domain of discourse (DoD) given by sentence $ U = \{ x|\phi(x) \}$ for some $\phi(x)$. Then naively we may wrote:</p>

<p>($\forall (x \in U)   \Phi(x) ) \equiv  ( \{ x|\phi(x) \} =&gt; \Phi(x) )$</p>

<p>In words: to say that some property follows for every x in DoD is the same as to say that if x is chosen from DoD then has this property.</p>

<p>We may try also the folowing one:
($\forall (x \in U)   \Phi(x) ) \equiv (( \{ x|\phi(x) \} =&gt; \Phi(x) ) =&gt; (\phi(x) &lt;=&gt; \Phi(x) ))$</p>

<p>In words: to say that some property follows for every x in DoD is the same as to say that $\phi$ and $\Phi$ are evenly spanned. </p>

<p>Do  You know any reference for such matter?</p>

<hr>

<p>Gabriel: Yes, I agree that from formal point of view in mathematical practice DoD is a set and to extend it to bigger universe usual is done by pure formal way and may be changed to some additional axioms etc. But this is some kind of mathematical practice: ""near every decent theory as far as we know is defined for DoD to be set or smaller but as it works also for proper classes we are trying to write it in a way"". But then we omit important statement: <strong>every time DoD has to be defined and additional axioms about it existence, definition,properties has to be added to the theory.</strong> I am only a hobbyist but I do not know any theorem which states: structure to be DoD for formal theory over countable language has to have ""this and this"" property. Of course for example as in formula $\{ x|\phi(x)\}$ we may require that $\phi(x)$ has some property. For example we may require that it is in first order language. Or in second order. Or in finite order language etc. For me is rather clear that it cannot be whatever I like. As far as I know we do not have any theory for that. But maybe I am wrong? </p>

<p>So my question is: what is that mean ""for all"" in a context of different definition of DoD ( as well as ""there exists""). Do we have clear meaning what it means for very big universes? We use some operator here named ""for all"" but have we possibility to define its meaning in syntactical way? If not, may we be sure that meaning of sentence ""for all"" is clearly defined? </p>

<p>I suggest this is example of <strong>Incomplete Inductive reasoning</strong> about possible ways of using general quantifier in mathematics. Moreover I suppose, even after reading something about Hilbert epsilon calculus that quantifiers has usual only intuitive meaning, that is its definition is far from such level of formality as for binary operation $\in$ for ZFC for example, where it may be anything (for example in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_hierarchy"" rel=""nofollow"">von Neumann hierarchy of sets</a> ""model"" of ZFC it is order). When we try to define formal theory we want to abstract from the ""meaning"" of the symbols and give only pure syntactical rules for them. As far as I know ( but I know not much) I do not know such definition for quantifiers, even in epsilon Hilbert calculus for example, because it <strong>omits the area of possible, acceptable or correct definitions of  domain of discourse.</strong></p>

"<p>Let ${\bf N}^\omega = \bigcup_{m=1}^\infty {\bf N}^m$ denote the space of all finite sequences $(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ of natural numbers.  For want of a better name, let me call a family ${\mathcal T} \subset {\bf N}^\omega$ a <em>blocking set</em> if every infinite sequence $N_1,N_2,N_3,N_4,\ldots$ of natural numbers must necessarily contain a blocking set $(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ as an initial segment.  (For the application I have in mind, one might also require that no element of a blocking set is an initial segment of any other element, but this is not the most essential property of these sets.)</p>

<p>One can think of a blocking set as describing a machine that takes a sequence of natural number inputs, but always halts in finite time; one can also think of a blocking set as defining a subtree of the rooted tree ${\bf N}^\omega$ in which there are no infinite paths.  Examples of blocking sets include</p>

<ol>
<li>All sequences $N_1,\ldots,N_m$ of length $m=10$.</li>
<li>All sequences $N_1,\ldots,N_m$ in which $m = N_1 + 1$.</li>
<li>All sequences $N_1,\ldots,N_m$ in which $m = N_{N_1+1}+1$.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason I happened across this concept is that such sets can be used to pseudo-finitise a certain class of infinitary statements.  Indeed, given any sequence $P_m(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ of $m$-ary properties, it is easy to see that the assertion</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There exists an infinite sequence $N_1, N_2, \ldots$ of natural numbers such that $P_m(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ is true for all $m$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every blocking set ${\mathcal T}$, there exists a finite sequence $(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ in ${\mathcal T}$ such that $P_m(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ holds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Indeed, the former statement trivially implies the latter, and if the former statement fails, then a counterexample to the latter can be constructed by setting the blocking set ${\mathcal T}$ to be those finite sequences $(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ for which $P_m(N_1,\ldots,N_m)$ fails.)</p>

<p>Anyway, this concept seems like one that must have been studied before, and with a standard name.  (I only used ""blocking set"" because I didn't know the existing name in the literature.)  So my question is: what is the correct name for this concept, and are there some references regarding the structure of such families of finite sequences?  (For instance, if we replace the natural numbers ${\bf N}$ here by a finite set, then by Konig's lemma, a family is blocking if and only if there are only finitely many finite sequences that don't contain a blocking initial segment; but I was unable to find a similar characterisation in the countable case.)</p>

"<p>It is well-known that the modal logic S4 is complete with respect to the class of all finite quasi-trees (where we interpret the $\Box$ modality as topological interior, and topologize a quasi-tree with the up-set topology). It is also well-known that p-morphisms (open, continuous surjections) preserve modal validity. Thus, for any space $X$, the existence of p-morphisms from $X$ onto every finite quasi-tree is a sufficient condition for $X$ to be S4-complete. This technique can be used to establish, for example, McKinsey and Tarski's famous result that S4 is the logic of any dense-in-itself, metrizable space.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this condition also necessary? Said differently: is there a space $X$ and a finite quasi-tree $Q$ such that $X$ is S4-complete but there exists no p-morphism $\rho: X \to Q$?</p>

<p>This seems like a natural question to ask, but I haven't had much luck in finding any discussion about it. Even just a pointer to the right body of literature would be very much appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong></p>

<p>Here I'll define my terms a little more carefully, and spell out the translation of my question in terms of the more standard Kripke semantics.</p>

<p>Recall that quasi-orders are sets equipped with reflexive, transitive binary relations, which is precisely the class of Kripke frames corresponding to S4. A quasi-order $Q = (Q,\leq)$ is called a quasi-tree if $Q/\sim$ is a tree, where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation on $Q$ defined by</p>

<p>$$x \sim y \iff x \leq y \textrm{ and } y \leq x.$$</p>

<p>As mentioned in the comments, there is a correspondence between quasi-orders and Alexandrov spaces, one direction of which is given by topologizing quasi-orders with the up-set topology. There is also a notion of a p-morphism between quasi-orders, nicely outlined <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripke_semantics#Model_constructions"" rel=""nofollow"">by Wikipedia</a>. A p-morphism between quasi-order corresponds to an open, continuous map between the corresponding Alexandrov spaces.</p>

<p>I use the phrase ""$X$ is S4-complete"" (perhaps somewhat idiosyncratically?) to mean that every formula validated by $X$ is provable in S4; equivalently, $X$ refutes all non-theorems of S4. It is known that if $Q$ is any quasi-order and for each <em>finite</em> quasi-tree $Q_{t}$ there exists a surjective p-morphism $\rho_{t}: Q \to Q_{t}$, then $Q$ is S4-complete. One can then ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the converse true? Does every S4-complete quasi-order Q admit maps $\rho_{t}$ as above?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If not, then a counter-example can be ""lifted"" into the topological setting, thus answering my original question. However, a positive answer to this question does not immediately resolve the topological version since the quantification in the topological version is over <em>all</em> spaces, rather than just the Alexandrov spaces. Nonetheless, I would be interested in an answer (or even a hint at an answer) to either question.</p>

"<p>If  $\text{ZF}$ is consistent, then it is not finitely axiomatizable. For if $\Gamma$ is a finite axiomatization, then $\text{ZF}$ proves by reflection that $\Gamma$ has a set model, and hence (since $\Gamma$ axiomatizes $\text{ZF}$) so does $\Gamma$. By the Second Incompleteness Theorem, $\Gamma$ is inconsistent. This is absurd, since it axiomatizes $\text{ZF}$.</p>

<p>The following therefore intrigues.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> There is a finite $\Gamma \subseteq \text{ZF}$ such that every transitive proper class model of $\Gamma$ verifies $\text{ZF}$.</p>

<p><em>I wish to know whether any obstacle prevents formalizing this in $\text{ZF}$. If not, how does that bear on the aforementioned theorem about finite axiomatizability?</em></p>

<p>For instance, if formalization is possible, it seems to follow that $\text{ZF}$ proves that, if $\text{ZF}$ is consistent, then $\Gamma$ has a model refuting $\text{ZF}$. Else ""every model of $\Gamma$ verifies $\text{ZF}$"" is consistent with $\text{ZF + Con(ZF)}$, which is absurd since the joint theory proves that $\text{ZF}$ both is and isn't finitely axiomatizable. But that's not very interesting. Perhaps the theorem implies something about nonfirstorderizability of transitivity? Do tell!</p>

<p>Here is a proof, the length of which merits apology. Seems formalizable to me!</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We specify $\Gamma$ in stages. First let it contain all axioms of $\text{ZF}$ besides Comprehension and Replacement. Next let $\Gamma$ contain the finitely many instances of Comprehension and Replacement needed, in addition to the above, to prove the facts invoked below about absoluteness and the cumulative hierarchy. Following Kunen, let $\text{En}(i,X,j)$ be the set of $j$-tuples from $X$ satisfying the $i$th formula in $j$ variables, relativized to $X$. Where $\ast$ denotes concatenation, write $\eta(m,n,s,t,A,B)$ for</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$m, n \in \omega \wedge t \in B \wedge A \in B \wedge s \in B^n \wedge s\ast\langle t, A \rangle \in \text{En}(m, B, n+2)$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and $\mu(m,n,s,t,A,B,y)$ for</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$m, n \in \omega \wedge t \in B \wedge A \in B \wedge s \in B^n \wedge y \in B \wedge s\ast\langle t, y, A \rangle \in \text{En}(m, B, n+3).$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, let $\Gamma$ contain the instance (+)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$\forall m,n,s,A,B\ \exists y\ \forall t\ [t \in y \leftrightarrow t \in A \wedge \eta(m,n,s,t,A,B)].$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>of Comprehension, and the instance (++)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$\forall m,n,s,A,B[\forall t \in A\ \exists!y\ \mu(m,n,s,t,A,B,y) \rightarrow \exists Y\ \forall t \in A\ \exists y \in Y\ \mu(m,n,s,t,A,B,y)]$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>of Replacement. Let nothing else be in $\Gamma$.</p>

<p>Now suppose $M$ is a transitive proper class model of $\Gamma$. To prove that $M$ verifies $\text{ZF}$, it suffices to check that it verifies arbitrary instances of Comprehension and Replacement. We do the former; the latter is similar, using (++) in place of (+). Let $\theta(w_1, \dots, w_n, t, A)$ be a formula, and take sets $w_1, \dots, w_n, A$ in $M$. By Comprehension in $V$, let $a$ be the set of all $t \in A$ such that $\theta^M(w_1, \dots, w_n, t, A)$. We aim to show that $a$ is an element of $M$.</p>

<p>Since $M$ is transitive and contains $A$, $a$ is a subset of $M$. And since $M$ verifies $\Gamma$, the tuple $s = \langle w_1, \dots, w_n \rangle$ is in $M$. Define a cumulative hierarchy on $M$ by setting $M_\alpha = M \cap V_\alpha$. By the reflection theorem, take $\beta &gt; \text{max rank}(a, A, s, \omega)$ such that $\theta$ and $\Gamma$ are absolute for $M_\beta$, $M$. Now $M_\beta$ is a transitive model of $\Gamma$ containing $w_1, \dots, w_n, A, s, \omega$, and each element of $a$. Moreover, $M_\beta \in M$, since $M$ thinks $V_\beta$ exists.</p>

<p>By definition of $\text{En}$ there is an integer $q$, the Gödel number of $\theta$, such that $\text{En}(q, M_\beta, n+2)$ is the set of (n+2)-tuple from $M_\beta$ satisfying $\theta^{M_\beta}$. Using (+) in $M$ with $m = q$ and $B = M_\beta$, and computing relativizations and absoluteness with the aid of $\Gamma$, there is $y \in M$ containing precisely the $t \in M$ such that $t \in A \wedge \theta^{M_\beta}(w_1, \dots, w_n, t, A)$. Since $a$ is a subset of $M_\beta$ and $\theta$ is absolute for $M_\beta$, $M$, this $y$ is just $a$. So $a$ is in $M$, as desired.</p>

<p>QED</p>

<p>By the way, the theorem is Exercise 7 in Chapter V of Kunen.</p>

It is known that testing, for a given sentence, whether the limit is 0 or whether it is 1 is PSPACE-complete (Grandjean, ""Complexity of the first-order theory of almost all finite structures"", <em>Information and Control</em> 1983). One possible approach to performing this sort of test would be to sample random graphs of sufficiently large size and test whether they model the sentence; but this would be limited both by the difficulty of testing whether a graph models a given sentence and also by the convergence rate of the 0-1 law, as that would control the size of the graphs needed in this sampling scheme.</p>

The sentence for this has length $O(k^2)$ but one needs to sample graphs of size at least exponential in $k$ to discover that the limit probability is one.

I understand that when the equality sign is used with $\omicron$/$O$ notation, it does not represent an equivalence relation.

However, this interpretation does not fit my intuition well.
When i write $\sin x = x + \omicron(x^2)$, $x→0$, i do not think about sets of functions, i think that i am replacing an anonymous implicitly understood function with a placeholder.
In other words, the designated object does not change (it is still a function or a number, not a set of functions or set of numbers), only the notation is abbreviated and made less explicit, a bit like when i write ""$1 + 2 + 3$"" instead of ""$((1 + 2) + 3)$"".</p>

"<p><strong>Update:</strong> Perhaps the question is too difficult. I would appreciate, thus, even just comments or related observations.</p>

<p>This question assumes familiarity with combinatorial cardinal characteristics of the continnum. It is the essence of an earlier question.</p>

<p>Let $[\mathbb{N}]^\infty$ be the family of infinite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$,
partially ordered by $\subseteq^*$, where $a\subseteq^* b$ means $a\setminus b$ is finite.</p>

<p>Let $\kappa$ be a cardinal number.

$\langle\, s_\alpha : \alpha&lt;\kappa\,\rangle$ in $[\mathbb{N}]^\infty$ such that</p>

<ol>
<li>This $\kappa$-sequence is $\subset^*$-decreasing as the ordinal number $\alpha$ increases.</li>
<li>The set $\{\,s_\alpha : \alpha&lt;\kappa\,\}$ has no pseudointersection.
(That is, there is no infinite set $s$ such that $s\subseteq^* s_\alpha$ for
all $\alpha&lt;\kappa$).</li>
</ol>

<p>An element $a\in [\mathbb{N}]^\infty$ is identified with its increasing enumeration. This way, the set $[\mathbb{N}]^\infty$ 
becomes the family of increasing functions in $\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$,
and the standard relation $\le^*$ is defined on 
$[\mathbb{N}]^\infty$.
A set $X\subseteq [\mathbb{N}]^\infty$ is <em>bounded</em> if it is bounded (from above) with respect to $\le^*$.</p>

<p>The general goal is to understand when is there an <em>unbounded</em> tower of height $\mathfrak{b}$. Let us call this axiom BT.</p>

<p>It is <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1090/S0002-9939-10-10407-9"" rel=""nofollow"">known</a> or easy to see that:</p>

<ol>
<li>An unbounded set has no pseudointersection. So we may remove the need for no pseudointersection from the definition of <em>tower</em> without altering BT.</li>
<li>If there is an unbounded tower of any cardinality, then BT holds.</li>
<li>If $\mathfrak{t}=\mathfrak{b}$ or $\mathfrak{b}&lt;\mathfrak{d}$, then BT holds.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Open-ended question.</strong> Can the axiom BT be expressed using (standard) 
cardinal characteristics of the continuum?</p>

BT also fails in the Laver model, indirectly by the main result of the <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1090/S0002-9939-10-10407-9"" rel=""nofollow"">linked paper</a>. I suspect that BT also fails in the Mathias model.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1.</strong> Does any additional inequality or inequality among cardinals of the continuum (one not following from 
$\mathfrak{t}=\mathfrak{b}$ or $\mathfrak{b}&lt;\mathfrak{d}$) imply BT? </p>

<p><strong>Question 2.</strong> Does BT imply any equality among cardinals of the continuum? </p>

<p>Since BT follows from CH, the hypotheisis BT does not imply any <em>in</em>equality.</p>

There are two different definitions, and they sometimes give different results.  </p>

<p>For the sake of discussion, I'll call them ""Type 1"" and ""Type 2"" ultraproducts.</p>

<p><strong>Type 2</strong> $\ $ View the poset $(\mathcal{U}, \subseteq)$ as a category.  The <strong>type 2 ultraproduct</strong> of $(X_i)_{i \in I}$ with respect to $\mathcal{U}$ is the colimit of the functor $(\mathcal{U}, \subseteq)^{\text{op}} \to \mathbf{Set}$ defined on objects by 
$$
J \mapsto \prod_{j \in J} X_j
$$
and on maps by projection.  Explicitly, then, the Type 2 ultraproduct is
$$
\Bigl( \coprod_{J \in \mathcal{U}} \prod_{j \in J} X_j \Bigr) \Bigl/ \approx
$$
where 
$$
(x_j)_{j \in J} \approx (x'_k)_{k \in K} \iff \{ i \in J \cap K: x_i = x'_i \} \in \mathcal{U}.
$$</p>

<p><strong>The difference</strong> $\ $ The two types of ultraproduct are the same if either none of the sets $X_i$ are empty or almost all of them are empty.  But in the remaining case, where at least one $X_i$ is empty but the set of such $i$ is not large enough to belong to $\mathcal{U}$, they're different: the Type 1 ultraproduct is empty but the Type 2 ultraproduct is not. </p>

<p><strong>The question</strong> $\ $ I've read in a couple of texts (both coming from the point of view of categorical logic) that the Type 2 ultraproduct is really the right one.  But why?  On what criteria is Type 2 judged to be better than Type 1?</p>

<p><strong>A vague guess at an answer</strong> $\ $ I think I can guess <em>very</em> roughly what's going on.  There's been a tradition in logic &mdash; maybe dying out now? &mdash; of taking all structures to be nonempty by definition.  But when you move to the more general setting of categorical logic, that's no longer a satisfactory approach.  Although in the category of sets, there's just a single object with no elements, in many other categories, there are lots of interesting objects with no (global) elements: e.g. there are lots of interesting sheaves with no global sections.  </p>

<p>So categorical logic sometimes involves a recasting of classical, set-based logic, in order to handle empty sets/types satisfactorily.  I imagine that something of the sort is going on here.  (I only defined ultraproducts of sets, but you could of course define ultraproducts of objects of any other sufficiently complete category.)  But still, I don't see clearly why Type 2 is the right choice.  </p>

(When I say ""exponential"", I mean either $e^x$ or the general $a^x$ for $a&gt;0$; obviously one can go back and forth between these so long as $e^x$ is indeed a bijection from surreals to positive surreals.)</p>

Gonshor seems to suggest in his text that his definition is equivalent to Kruskal's unpublished one, but on the other hand never seems to explicitly state so.</li>
<li>Norman Alling's ""Foundations of Analysis over Surreal Number Fields"" looks like it might contain another definition?  I'm not too clear on what he's doing, honestly, though it looks like it's restricted to non-infinite surreals...</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surreal_number&amp;oldid=476475571#.22..._and_Beyond..22"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia's page</a> [old version, this definition was removed from Wikipedia soon after asking this question] gives a totally uncited definition for $2^x$.  I have no idea where this might be originally from.  I suppose one could substitute in other surreals for 2 to generalize this?</li>
<li>Or else one could take Wikipedia's definition and generalize it in the way one usually does when starting from $e^x$? (I should hope this agrees with definition 4!).</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the operation $x\mapsto \omega^x$ commonly used in the surreals is not related; though it's exponential in some sense, it's not surjective onto the positive surreals, and so definitions of a general exponential shouldn't attempt to agree with it. And of course definitions 1, 2, and 4/5 above are surjective onto the positive surreals.  (Or Wikipedia claims #4/5 is, anyway.)</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: To avoid confusion, in what follows, I'll write $\exp_\omega x$ instead of the usual $\omega^x$, and reserve the notation $\omega^x$ for whatever that happens to be in the notion of exponentiation under discussion.</p>

<p>So, does anyone know to what extent these are actually equivalent?  If they're not equivalent, is there agreement on which ones are the ""right"" definitions?  (It seems like <em>all</em> of them have the right properties!  And while it seems to be agreed that the idea behind Kruskal's definition is bad, that doesn't mean necessarily the definition itself is.)  Or could anyone point me to any recent book which might clear all this up, or at least the source of Wikipedia's definition?</p>

<p>(I had originally intended to ask other questions about surreal exponentiation before finding that I wasn't sure what it actually was.  I am hoping that whatever references people can point me to will answer my other questions as well.)</p>

<p><strong>Slight update</strong>: Definitions 4 doesn't seem to agree with definition 5 (nor definition 1, see below); it would seem that definition 4 would imply $3^\omega=\omega$, while definition 5 would imply $3^\omega&gt;\omega$.  This raises the problem in that one could make more definitions by using definition 4 to define $a^x$ for some fixed $a$, and then generalizing it to $b^x$ for all $b$ via definition 5, and depending on your choice of starting $a$ -- whether $e$, 2, or something else -- you'd get different definitions of $b^x$ out.  An entire proper class of distinct ""exponentiation"" operations!  Well, perhaps not, perhaps not all starting values of $a&gt;1$ yield an onto function -- perhaps 2 is special and it's the only one that does, though that seems pretty unlikely, and barring that, this is pretty bad regardless.  Also, definition 4 seems pretty suspect as the ""right"" definition for another reason: If we plug in two ordinals, it looks like it will agree with ordinary ordinal exponentiation.  This both disagees with Gonshor's definition (which would imply $\omega^\omega&gt;\exp_\omega \omega$) and is suspect on its own, because we shouldn't expect to get one of the <em>ordinary</em> ordinal operations out of this (we use natural addition and multiplication in the surreals, not ordinary addition and multiplication).  If indeed we get an ordinal operation out of this at all -- it would appear that by Gonshor's definition, $\omega^\omega$ would not even be an ordinal, instead being equal to $\exp_\omega \exp_\omega (1+1/\omega)$.</p>

<li><p>How we can determine the structure of $F_{Var^-(A)}(X)$? I mean an answer like polynomial functions given by Anton Klaychko or the extendblity  criterion given by Benjamin Steinberg in my previous question.</p></li>
<li><p>Can we characterize $Var^-(A)$ using class operators? I mean some thing like HSP. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>P.S. To answer the question $F_{Var^-(A)}(X)=$?, one should determine the set of all identities with variables from $X$ which are logical consequence of the set $id^-(A)$. More precisely, suppose 
$$
R(X)=\{ (p, q):\ id^-(A)\vDash p=q\}.
$$
Then we have $F_{Var^-(A)}(X)=T_{\mathcal{L}}(X)/R(X)$, where $T_{\mathcal{L}}(X)$ is the term algebra. So, to answer the first question, one should say that: which identities are logical consequences of  given negated identities. For example, suppose $\mathcal{L}=(0,1, +, -, \times)$. Is it possible to determine all non-trivial identities which can be deduce from the negated identity
$$
\forall x \forall y: x^2+y^2\neq-1?
$$
Honestly, I have no even one example of non-trivial identity deducible from the above negated identity.</p>

<p>In the first edition of Elliott Mendelson's classic <em>Introduction to Mathematical Logic</em> (1964) there is an appendix, giving a version of Schütte's (1951) variation on Gentzen's proof of the consistency of PA. This is intriguing stuff, crisply and quite accessibly presented. The appendix is, however, suppressed in later editions (in fact, from the second onwards), even though there is plenty of room given to other materials and a new appendix</p>

<p>Now, a number of people have said that the appendix is one of the most interesting things about the book. I agree. I too remember being quite excited by it when I first came across it a long time ago!</p>

The key observation here is that the length of this induction is bounded above by the length of the Kleene-Brouwer ordering $G_{KB}$, which is a computable ordinal and hence $&lt;\omega_1^{CK}$, and that each successive stage of the induction can be achieved by one application of the jump operator, so there is a winning strategy with complexity at most $0^{(\vert G_{KB}\vert)}$.</p>

<p>(An annoying subtlety here is that the theory $\Delta^1_1-CA_0$, which amounts to closure under hyperarithmeticity, does <em>not</em> prove determinacy of clopen games, since there are games which are not actually clopen but have no hyperarithmetic witnesses to their ill-foundedness.)</p>

"<p>A celebrated theorem of Milnor and Kervaire asserts that any finite dimensional division algebra over the real numbers has dimension 1,2,4 or 8. This result is established using methods from algebraic topology, such as K-Theory.</p>

<p>Now  for any given natural number $n$ the existence of such an algebra of dimension $n$ is expressible as an  assertion $\phi_n$ in the first-order language of field theory. Since the theory $RCF$ of real closed fields is complete, it follows from the theorem  above that  $RCF \vdash   \neg \phi_n$ for all $n\not\in$ {1,2,4,8}. Here the universal quantifier on $n$ is in the meta-theory: we might  say that for  each $n$ there is an elementary  proof of $\phi_n$. </p>

<p>Given such a theorem  scheme, one might wonder whether there might be a  uniform elementary proof. Informally this could mean a proof  by induction on the relevant complexity parameter: for example,  $$RCF \vdash  \mbox{ any degree } d  \mbox{  polynomial has at most  }  d  \mbox{ roots}.$$
I would like to imagine that  there  is some first  order-theory  which suitably contains both  RCF and Peano Arithmetic (in particular,  so  as to enable  discussion of  finite sequences of field elements) in which the assertion $$\forall n \;\phi_n\leftrightarrow(n=1 \vee n=2  \vee n=4 \vee  n=8)$$ can  be  legfitimately formalized. Are there standard  constructions for  supporting finite sequences? If so, it should follow from completeness of RCF  that this  assertion  is  equivalent (within such  a larger theory)  to  a sentence $\Phi$ in the language of arithmetic. As noted  above, via difficult results from topology, $\Phi$ is true in the standard model  of  Peano Arithmetic. Consequently, it makes sense to ask whether $\Phi$ is provable within Peano Arithmetic. </p>

<p>Some questions:</p>

<p>(1) Can such a recipe be formalized, and does it reasonably capture the notion of  ""uniform elementary proof"" or  ""purely algebraic"" proof for such theorem schemes? Here I am not necessarily claiming that these conjectural notions are the same.</p>

<p>(2) In the given example of the 1,2,4,8 theorem, do we expect $\Phi$ to be provable in Peano Arithmetic? </p>

<p>Perhaps I have been looking in the wrong places, but all I have managed  to find are a few comments by Kreisel about ""unwinding"", on pages 67-68 of this note: <a href=""http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/zr/10/n010p063.pdf"">http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/zr/10/n010p063.pdf</a></p>

<p>The situation could be compared with what is known in the special cases of commutative division
algebras (dimensions 1,2) and associative division algebras (dimensions 1,2,4). Hopf's proof of the (1,2) theorem also uses some topology, namely that the $n$-dimensional sphere and $n$-dimensional projective space are not homeomorphic when $n&gt;1$; in fact it suffices to show that a specific map   between these spaces is not a homeomorphism.  Perhaps there is an elementary way to formulate
this consideration?  On the other hand,  there is a different and
""purely algebraic"" proof, via Bezout's Theorem. I don't have the reference at hand,  but it there is a citation  (froom the 1950s, as I recall) in the Springer-Verlag  book Numbers (Ebbinghaus et. al.). I've seen this proof dismissed as unreadable or unenlightening,
but when I examined it years ago it seemed like it might qualify.
The Frobenius proof of the (1,2,4) theorem is quite evidently purely
algebraic, as is the later extension (1,2,4,8) to alternative division

<p><strong>Some motivation:</strong></p>

<p>If $\delta$ is a Woodin cardinal, then it remains so after any $\delta$-closed forcing.  It is a theorem of Woodin and Shelah that if $\delta$ is Woodin and $G \subseteq Col(\omega_1,&lt;\delta)$ is generic, then in $V[G]$ there is a saturated ideal on $\omega_1$.</p>

<p>Jech and Prikry showed that if CH holds and there is a saturated ideal on $\omega_1$, then $2^{\omega_1} = \omega_2$.  Thus if $\delta$ is inaccessible and $G \times H \subseteq Col(\omega_1,&lt;\delta) \times Add(\omega_1,\delta^+)$ is generic, then $V[G][H]$ has no saturated ideals on $\omega_1$.</p>

<p>But if $K \subseteq Col(\delta,\delta^+)$ is generic, then $V[K] \models Col(\omega_1,&lt;\delta) \times Add(\omega_1,(\delta^+)^V) \cong Col(\omega_1,&lt;\delta)$.  Thus if $G,H,K$ are mutually generic, then $V[G][H][K]$ has a saturated ideal on $\omega_1$.</p>

<p>By the $\delta$-c.c., $Col(\delta,\delta^+)^V$ remains $\delta$-distributive in $V[G][H]$.  So we can force over $V[G][H]$ to add a saturated ideal on $\omega_1$ without adding subsets of $\omega_1$.  But the question was whether we can do this with a $\delta$-closed forcing.</p>

<p>I vaguely remember reading somewhere that there was a known method analogous to the method of Sturm chains for polynomials... But I haven't been able to figure out what it should be, nor have I been able to find where I read that claim. My best guess is that we can get rid of terms of such an expression by first dividing $f$ by an exponential $e^{\alpha x}$ to make a term constant, differentiating, and then multiplying by that same exponential. If we call this operation $D_{\alpha}$, we get
$D_{\alpha}f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^k c_i(\alpha_i-\alpha)e^{\alpha_ix}$.
The nice thing is that $D_{\alpha}f$ acts analogously to the derivative of $f$, i.e. between any consecutive zeroes of $f$ there is a zero of $D_{\alpha}f$. The problem is that I can't think of a good analogue to the division algorithm for exponential polynomials (maybe we don't need one?).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> When I say that Tarski's exponential function problem is ""all but solved,"" I mean that all that is missing from the full solution is a proof of Schanuel's conjecture. I'm not saying that Schanuel's conjecture is easy, but given this result it seems to me that we should be able to describe some sort of explicit algorithm for deciding problems like this one, although the proof of correctness of such an algorithm might require us to assume Schanuel's conjecture holds.</p>

Intuitively, however, the difference between $U$ and $V$ is ""small"" (to be fair, this ""intuition"" may just be a figment of my not understanding inner model theory); is this somehow reflected by the lattice $D(U, V)$? In general, can anything about the relationship between $U$ and $V$ be read off of the lattice $D(U, V)$?</p>

"<p>First, a rather broad question: has there been any work on what, given a model $M$ of set theory, we can say about those models of set theory $N$ and posets $\mathbb{P}$ such that $\mathbb{P}\in N$ and $M=N[G]$ for some $G$ $\mathbb{P}$-generic over $N$?</p>

<p>Second, a more specific question. Let a poset $\mathbb{P}$ be $detectable$ if there is some sentence $\phi_\mathbb{P}$ in the language of set theory + a constant denoting $\mathbb{P}$ such that for all $M$ with $\mathbb{P}\in M$, we have $(M, \mathbb{P})\models\phi\iff M=N[G]$ for some model $N$ with $\mathbb{P}\in N$ and $G$ $\mathbb{P}$-generic over $N$. What posets are detectable? [Answered in the comments by Amit Kumar Gupta.]</p>

<p>Finally, an incredibly general question. Let $M$ be a model of $ZFC$, $\mathcal{C}$ a class of posets in $M$. Say $\mathcal{C}$ is $consistent$ if there is some elementary extension $N$ of $M$ such that, for all $\mathbb{P}\in \mathcal{C}$, there is some $N_\mathbb{P}\models ZFC$ with $\mathbb{P}\in N_\mathbb{P}$ and some $G$ $\mathbb{P}$-generic over $N_\mathbb{P}$ such that $N=N_\mathbb{P}[G]$. What are the consistent classes like? Can we say anything interesting about them?</p>

<p>I'm not sure if these questions are meaningful, or - even assuming they are - if they are interesting.

"<p>I'm sure this is just my google-fu failing me, but: what are sufficient, non-overkill large cardinal axioms which guarantee ""Every (boldface) $\Pi^1_n$ set of (real codes for) countable ordinals contains or is disjoint from a club subset of $\omega_1$""? (I asked this question on math.stackexchange a couple weeks ago <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1539202/clubbiness-of-pi1-n-sets"">http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1539202/clubbiness-of-pi1-n-sets</a>, and received some attention but no answer.)</p>

<p>To clarify, I'm asking about the strength <em>over ZFC</em>.</p>

<p>Here's a very silly upper bound: suppose $L(\mathbb{R})$ is a model of AD, and moreover every $\Pi^1_n$-sentence with real parameters is absolute between $L(\mathbb{R})$ and $V$ (actually, I think this is already a consequence of ""$L(\mathbb{R})\models AD$,"" but I'm not sure). Then let $A\in V$ be a $\Pi^1_n$-set of countable ordinals, via the formula (with real parameters) $\varphi$. By the absoluteness assumption, $\varphi^{L(\mathbb{R})}=A$, so $A\in L(\mathbb{R})$. And since $L(\mathbb{R})\models AD$, $L(\mathbb{R})$ thinks $A$ contains or is disjoint from a club. But inner models compute club-ness correctly, so we're done.</p>

"<p>As I understand it, there is a program in set theory to produce an ultimate, canonical model of set theory which, among other things, positively answers the Continuum Hypothesis and various questions about large cardinals.  My question is about the motivation of such a program.  I'll present some of the thoughts that motivate my question and then state my question more precisely at the end.</p>

<p>Naively, one would think that a good first order theory for some subject ought to be able to decide any first-order expressible question about that subject.  Given certain reasonable restrictions on what ""good"" must entail, this is impossible, due to Godel.  Still, there is a sense that even though a good theory cannot answer every first order question, it should answer a reasonable subset of them.  Further still, there is a sense that for any given subject, there are certain first order propositions that a good theory should not only decide, but decide to be true.</p>

<p>What I just said may sound vague, so in the next two paragraphs I'll add examples of things I personally ought to be true or decidable in a good theory.  The point of these examples is simply to provide background and motivation to the question, and clarify any vagueness, the actual content of those paragraphs is just my opinion and not the real point of the question I'm asking here.</p>

<p><b>Things that ought to be true</b><br>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_arithmetic"">Robinson Arithmetic</a> doesn't decide induction, but induction ought to hold in any good theory of numbers.  Replacement and Foundation aren't decided by Zermelo set theory, but they ought to hold in any decent theory of sets, even if it took decades for these axioms to join the rest of Zermelo's axioms.  Now there may be interesting theories extending Robinson Arithmetic in which induction fails, and interesting theories extending Zermelo set theory in which Replacement or Foundation fail, but these aren't good theories of numbers or sets, respectively.  Now I cannot prove induction or Replacement, and I may not be able to convince the extreme skeptic that my beliefs are nothing more than the result of cultural bias and upbringing.  Nonetheless, I can confidently assert that induction is true amd Replacement holds.  And even if I were tempted to prove these claims based on some more fundamental assumptions, the skeptic could just as well question those assumptions, and this leads to infinite regress.</p>

<p><b>Things that ought to be decidable</b><br>
A good theory of numbers ought to decide Goldbach's Conjecture.  A good theory of sets probably ought to decide CH and the existence of various large cardinals.  Again, I can't prove these claims, I'm simply making normative claims about what ought to be true of a theory if it is to be regarded as good.  On the other hand, a good theory need not decide its own consistency.  Excessively contrived formulas need not be decidable by a good theory either (e.g. formulas constructed simply to prove a certain theory is incomplete).</p>

<p><b>Main Question</b><br>
I feel that CH and the existence or non-existence of large cardinals should be decidable in a good set theory, or in the same vein, if there are to be some canonical models of set theory, they should all decide these questions the same way.  </p>

<p><i>But various prominent set theorists${}^{\dagger}$ believe further that CH should be true and large cardinals should exist in the ""true $V$.""  What are some of the motivations for these beliefs?</i></p>

<p>[EDIT]<br>
Although I feel this question is different from ones that have already been asked here, let me further distinguish my question by adding that I've heard the usual responses such as:  </p>

<ul>
<li>There are models with very nice structural properties in which large cardinals exist</li>
<li>Large cardinal axioms form a surprisingly linear hierarchy</li>
<li>They decide many natural questions</li>
<li>They fit together in a way that gives a nice, coherent picture of the universe</li>
<li>Why not add them?</li>
</ul>

<p>These responses implicitly appear to justify large cardinal axioms on some non-classical, non-platonist notion of truth - some combination of an aesthetic/pragmatic/coherentist theory of truth.  So perhaps I should refine my question to be:</p>

<p><i>What motivates many set theorists to evaluate new axioms by these non-classical standards (or am I way off base)?</i></p>

<p>I should emphasize that I'm not only interested in the justification of these new axioms, but the motivation behind justifying these axioms the way that set theorists appear to justify them, as these axioms seem to be justified in a categorically different way from how Peano's axioms or Zermelo's axioms are justified.
[/EDIT]</p>

<p>${}^{\dagger}$This <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_cardinal#Motivations_and_epistemic_status"">Wikipedia article on Large Cardinals</a> mentions <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabal_%28set_theory%29"">the Cabal</a> for instance.</p>

<p><b>Secondary Question</b><br>
I've made some specific claims about specific statements in specific theories that I feel ought to be true or ought to at least be decidable.  Admittedly I haven't given any general explanations for what sort of things ought to be true, false, decidable, or neither, I've just stated my opinion on a few specific sentences.  I doubt one could give a totally general account distinguishing the class of problems that ought to be decidable from the class of problems that needn't be (e.g. make a categorical distinction between statements ""like"" CH versus statements ""like"" Godel's self-referential sentence).  I don't think it's the type of question amenable to total generalization or formalization.  Nonetheless:</p>

"<p>[Metastuff: I asked this question in a slightly different way on mathSE last week, and it didn't go anywhere, which is why I am asking here. I added the DST tag because it's basically a problem about Borel equivalence relations stripped of all the Borelness constraints. I do need help, so helpful redirection is appreciated.]</p>

<p>I am trying to give a somewhat constructive definition of a function. It's somewhat constructive because I'll freely assume that I can well-order any set. Aside from that, I want to say what the function looks like.</p>

<p>I have two equivalence relations $E$ and $F$ on spaces $X$ and $Y$, respectively. There are no restrictions on the sizes of anything. I want to define a function $f : X \to Y$ such that
$$ x E y \Leftrightarrow f(x) F f(y)\;\;\;\text{ and }\;\;\;f(x) = f(y) \Rightarrow x = y $$
for all $x,y \in X$. This makes $f$ send all points in an $E$-class to the same $F$-class and also be injective on equivalence classes (i.e., injective as $X/E \to Y/F$) and on the underlying space.</p>

<p>Let $I$ be the class of nonzero cardinals. For every $i \in I$, the number of $F$-classes of size at least $i$ is greater than or equal to the number of $E$-classes of size at least $i$. I want to give a mostly-constructive proof that this is sufficient for there to be a function as described above (from $E$ to $F$), i.e., I want to describe the function.</p>

<p>I have been struggling with this on and off for several weeks. Below are some possible time-savers for you guys. If you already have a solution, you can skip it.</p>

<hr>

<p>The problem is extremely easy in the slightly nicer situation where, for every $i \in I$, the number of $F$-classes of size <strong>exactly</strong> $i$ is greater than or equal to the number of $E$-classes of size <strong>exactly</strong> $i$. Just partition the set of $E$-classes by size and put a well-order on each set in the partition. Do the same for $F$-classes. Then send the $n$th $E$-class of size $i$ to the $n$th $F$-class of size $i$.</p>

<p>The complication for the original case is that you might have to send an $E$-class of size $i$ to an $F$-class of size $j$ with $i &lt; j$. Two problems arise this way.</p>

<p>First, you can't use the larger classes wastefully by sending relatively small classes to them. E.g., if $E$ has solely two classes, one of size $2$ and one of size $5$, and $F$ has solely two classes, one of size $4$ and one of size $6$, you cannot send the class of size $2$ to the class of size $6$. The only way that I can think to avoid this problem is inductively: (i) well-order the classes in some way, (ii) send the least $E$-class to the least $F$-class that is big enough, (iii) remove these, and (iv) repeat from step (ii).</p>

<p>This creates the second problem: how to choose the well-order for step (i). If you try, e.g., to order the classes by increasing size with an arbitrary order among classes of the same size, you run into the following problem (as Brian Scott pointed out to me on mathSE a week ago). Suppose $E$ has $\omega$ many classes of size $1$ and one class of size $2$. Suppose $F$ has one class each of every finite size. Then the above won't work because $F$ has order-type $\omega$, but $E$ has order-type $\omega+1$.</p>

<p>You can fix this case with the same trick that you use to well-order the rationals. Put the $E$-classes of size $i$ into a column and well-order each column. <a href=""http://mathlesstraveled.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/rational-grid-diag-enum.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Then move along the diagonals like so.</a> But it's not clear to me what this looks like when you have any number of columns and rows rather than just countably many. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit to explain potential solution:</strong> It sounds plausible to me that sending an $E$-class to an $F$-class of the smallest available size that is large enough will avoid fatally wasteful assignments regardless of the order in which you make assignments. E.g., given an $E$-class of size $5$, if $F$-classes of sizes $4,7,$ and $9$ are available, choose one of size $7$.</p>

<p>The problem then is just how to iterate through the $E$-classes. This sounds problematic generally, but my knowledge of ordinals is weak. E.g., is there always some sense in which you can iterate through all the members of an initial ordinal?</p>

<p>Put the $E$-classes into <a href=""http://mathlesstraveled.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/rational-grid-diag-enum.png"" rel=""nofollow"">an array like this one</a> so that an $E$-class has an index <strong>(column,row)</strong>. Let the index $(s,p)$ mean that $s$ is the size of the $E$-class and $p$ is its arbitrarily-assigned position in the column. </p>

<p>Consider the case where you have at most countably many $E$-classes of each size and only countably many possible infinite sizes. That is, $p \in \omega$ and $s \in \omega \times \lbrace 0,1\rbrace$. That is, you have countably many finite sizes (tagged with $0$) and countably many infinite sizes (tagged with $1$). Then you just have two copies of the above array; one for finite sizes and one for infinite sizes. </p>

<p>Separately snake through each of them in the way depicted in the linked picture. For the array of finite sizes, this hits indices in this order: $((1,0),1), ((1,0),2), ((2,0),1), ((1,0),3), \ldots$, where the $0$ indicates that you're in the ""finite"" array. For the array of infinite sizes, this hits the indices in this (analogous) order: $((1,1),1), ((1,1),2), ((2,1),1), ((1,1),3), \ldots$. Here, $(1,1)$ denotes some infinite size such as $\omega$; $(2,1)$ might be $2^\omega$, and so on.</p>

<p>Finally, interleave the two orders that you got from snaking through each array. Most simply, you can take one member from each order at a time. This gives:
$$((1,0),1), ((1,1),1), ((1,0),2), ((1,1),2), ((2,0),1), ((2,1),1), ((1,0),3), \ldots$$</p>

<p>I apologize for the somewhat cumbersome notation, but I hope that the pattern becomes clear.</p>

<p>Incidentally, you won't necessarily have an $E$-class for all of the points in the above arrays. E.g., you might not have any $E$-classes of size $2$. I am assuming the fullest possible case for simplicity, as it still defines a well-order when you remove some of the points.</p>

"<p>If $_DV_D$ is a $D$-$D$-bimodule, and we have a $D$-basis for $V_D$, do we still need AC to get a $D$-basis for $_DV$?</p>

<p>(The original question appears below.  But this shorter question gets at the heart of my question, and makes it clear it has more logical foundations.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Let $D$ be a division ring and let $_D V_D$ be a $D$-$D$-bimodule.  If we temporarily forget the left module structure, and just look at the right $D$-module structure, we have $V_D= \bigoplus_{i\in I}e_iD$ for some basis $\{e_i\}_{i\in I}$.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that $E:={\rm End}(V_D)\cong {\rm CFM}_I(D)$ where ${\rm CFM}_I(D)$ is the ring of $I\times I$ <em>column finite matrices</em>.  These are the matrices where each column has only finitely many nonzero entries.  If we think of the elements of $V_D$ as columns of size $I\times 1$ with only finitely many nonzero entries, then ${\rm CFM}_I(D)$ acts on the left of $V_D$ simply by matrix multiplication.  (Of course, when $|I|=n$ is finite, then ${\rm CFM}_I(D)=\mathbb{M}_n(D)$ is just the usual ring of $n\times n$ matrices.)</p>

<p>So we have a natural bimodule structure on $V$, namely $_{E}V_D$.  Our original bimodule structure $_DV_D$ gives rise to a homomorphism $\varphi:D\to E\cong {\rm CFM}_I(D)$.  Conversely, given any such homomorphism (and a fixed basis for $V_D$ indexed by $I$) we get a $D$-$D$-module structure on $V$.</p>

<p>We could do all of this over again on the other side.  From the <em>left</em> $D$-module structure $_DV$, we can fix a basis $\{f_j\}_{j\in J}$ and corresponding decomposition $_DV=\bigoplus_{j\in J}Df_j$.  The right $D$-module structure then corresponds to a homomorphism $\psi:D\to {\rm RFM}_J(D)$.  (The ring ${\rm RFM}_J(D)$ is the ring of $J\times J$ row finite matrices.)</p>

<p>So given an index set $I$ and a homomorphism $\varphi:D\to {\rm CFM}_I(D)$, there is a corresponding index set $J$ and a homomorphism $\psi:D\to {\rm RFM}_J(D)$.  My question is whether there is a canonical way to describe the correspondence $(I,\varphi)\leftrightarrow(J,\psi)$.  If not a canonical way, given the information $I$ and $\varphi$, can we at least describe $|J|$ and $\psi$ explicitly from that data, after a choice of basis?</p>

In the inductive step, I guess one is integrating the lengths of some line segments, and these are given in terms of roots of polynomials, so you use some results about analyticity of roots of polynomials as a function of the coefficients...  I think I could eventually give a rigorous proof, but this seems like the kind of thing that must be well-known (again, if it's true!) to the right people.

  <p>Under what circumstances are there any $k$-algebra homomorphisms $k^X \to k$ apart from the projections?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some observations.  Observation 2 shows that the question is not entirely trivial, in the sense that there <em>are</em> sometimes nontrivial homomorphisms $k^X \to k$.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When $k$ an integral domain, any homomorphism $\Phi: k^X \to k$ gives rise to an ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}_\Phi$ on $X$.  To see this, write $\chi_S \in k^X$ for the characteristic function of a subset $S \subseteq X$.  Since $\chi_S$ is idempotent, $\Phi(\chi_S)$ is also idempotent, and is therefore either $0$ or $1$.  Write
$$
\mathcal{U}_\Phi
=
\{ S \subseteq X : \Phi(\chi_S) = 1 \}.
$$
It's easy to check that $\mathcal{U}_\Phi$ is an ultrafilter on $X$ &mdash;  <a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/questions/69467/an-ultrafilter-is-a-set-of-subsets-containing-exactly-one-element-of-each-finite/129930"">in other words</a>, that whenever we write $X = X_1 \amalg \cdots \amalg X_n$, there is precisely one $i$ for which $\Phi(\chi_{X_i}) = 1$.</p></li>
<li><p>When $k$ is a <em>finite</em> integral domain &mdash; that is, a finite field &mdash; the $k$-algebra homomorphisms $k^X \to k$ are in bijection with the ultrafilters on $X$.  One direction of this correspondence is given as in (1).  </p>

<p>For the other, start with an ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $X$.  We want to define a homomorphism $\Phi_{\mathcal{U}}: k^X \to k$, so take $\phi \in k^X$.  Since $k$ is finite, the fibres $(\phi^{-1}(c))_{c \in k}$ form a finite partition of $X$.  So there is precisely one element $c \in k$ such that $\phi^{-1}(c) \in \mathcal{U}$, and we put $\Phi_{\mathcal{U}}(\phi) = c$.  It's straightforward to check that $\Phi_{\mathcal{U}}$ is a homomorphism and that the processes $\mathcal{U} \mapsto \Phi_{\mathcal{U}}$ and $\Phi \mapsto \mathcal{U}_\Phi$ are mutually inverse.</p></li>
<li><p>When $k$ is an integral domain and $X$ (rather than $k$) is finite, the only homomorphisms $k^X \to k$ are the projections.  This follows e.g. from (1) and the fact that ultrafilters on a finite set are principal.</p></li>
<li><p>Denote by $X \cdot k$ the $k$-vector space with basis $X$.  Then $k^X$, as a $k$-vector space, is isomorphic to the space of linear maps $X \cdot k \to k$.  Now any $k$-algebra homomorphism $\Phi: k^X \to k$ is, in particular, a $k$-linear map, so $\Phi$ is an element of the double dual of $X \cdot k$.  Hence there can only be nontrivial homomorphisms $k^X \to k$ if there are nontrivial elements of the double dual of $X \cdot k$.  </p>

<p>So my question seems to be closely related to one that's come up <a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/questions/49388"">a few times</a> <a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/questions/49351"">here before</a>: how much Choice do we need in order to construct nontrivial elements of the double dual of an infinite-dimensional vector space?</p></li>

"<p>It is a somewhat curious phenomenon that, in forcing arguments, one usually doesn't care about any particular properties of the generic filter being used (this isn't strictly true; there are cases where we force below some sort of master condition, for example, but this basically amounts to asking my question for the cone below the condition). This position might possibly be preferred by mathematicians who interpret talking about generic filters as ""semantic sugar"" for purely syntactic arguments about Boolean truth values, but if we are prepared to talk about generics as real objects, it seems weird that we don't pay very much attention to the structure of the objects which generate our extensions.</p>

<p>But perhaps we needn't always care about the particular generic. Let $M$ be a transitive model of set theory. Call a notion of forcing $\mathbb{P}\in M$ <em>forcing agnostic</em> (over $M$) if for any two $M$-generic filters $G,H\subseteq \mathbb{P}$ the two extensions $M[G]$ and $M[H]$ are elementarily equivalent.</p>

<p>There is an obvious reformulation of forcing agnosticism: $\mathbb{P}$ is forcing agnostic iff the Boolean value, with respect to the Boolean algebra associated to $\mathbb{P}$, of any sentence (without parameters in the forcing language) is either 0 or 1. This immediately implies that any almost homogeneous forcing is forcing agnostic; in fact, any two extensions by almost homogeneous forcing are elementarily equivalent in the language augmented with constants for elements of the ground model.</p>

<p>Is there a characterization of forcing agnostic posets? Is this a purely structural property of the poset or does the ambient model matter, i.e. can  a poset be forcing agnostic over some models but not over others?</p>

<p>I would also welcome any examples of forcing arguments where some care is needed in choosing the generic (in addition to ensuring a particular condition gets in).</p>

"<p>Standard textbooks in mathematical logic will assume an infinite supply of variables. Their axiomatization of first order logic will typically contain an axiom of the form $\forall x\phi_{1}\to\phi_{1}[y/x]$ with varying qualifications on what the term $y$ is allowed to be, along the lines of '$y$ is free for $x$ in $\phi_{1}$'. When the set of variables $V$ is finite, the standard textbook approach creates a problem: the formula $\forall x\forall y(x\in y)\to\forall x(y\in x)$ with $x\neq y$ is not an axiom. In general, this is hardly a problem as the set of variable $V$ will have a spare variable $z\not\in\{x,y\}$ allowing us to show that $\forall x\forall y(x\in y)\to\forall x(y\in x)$ is in fact a theorem. However, when $V=\{x,y\}$ there doesn't seem to be any way to prove the formula and we are left with a valid formula which cannot be proven. So whenever $V$ is a finite set, we can easily believe that excluding the axiom $\forall x\phi_{1}\to\phi_{1}[y/x]$ simply because $y$ is not free for $x$ in $\phi_{1}$ (without any substitute), will create a situation where a perfectly reasonable formula such as $\forall x\forall y(x\in y)\to\forall x(y\in x)$ which should have been an axiom, will fail to be included while not being a theorem, thereby leading to an incomplete axiomatization. Somehow we need a way to specify all axioms $\forall x\phi_{1}\to\phi_{1}[y/x]$ without leaving anyone out. Because $V$ is a finite set, we cannot hope to define a substitution of variable mapping $[y/x]:{\bf P}(V)\to{\bf P}(V)$ simply by using fresh variables which haven't yet been used. We fundamentally need to re-use variables, while avoiding capture. This I believe is the key issue which needs to be resolved so as to offer a sensible axiomatization of FOL with finitely many variables (but I could be wrong about this). So my question is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question 1</strong>: Can anyone suggest an axiomatization of FOL with $V$ finite which is known to be sound, complete and in which the deduction theorem holds without qualification on closed formulas?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Question 2</strong>: Is there a known reference which deals with this question? (answered by Andres and Francois)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One may assume no constant or function symbol, and a unique binary predicate $\in$ for the purpose of this post. </p>

<p>My personal approach to defining an <em>essential</em> substitution $[y/x]:{\bf P}(V)\to{\bf P}(V)$ is to create a mapping ${\cal M}:{\bf P}(V)\to{\bf P}(V\oplus\mathbb{N})$ which effectively replaces every bound variable of its argument by an element of a copy of $\mathbb{N}$ which is disjoint from $V$, while avoiding capture. So for example ${\cal M}(\forall x(x\in y))=\forall\,0(0\in y)$ and ${\cal M}(\forall y\forall x(x\in y))=\forall\,1\forall\,0(0\in 1)$ (the '$y$' has been replaced by $1$ instead of $0$ to avoid capture):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Minimal Transform of formula:</strong></p>
  
  <p>${\cal M}(\forall x\phi_{1})=\forall n{\cal M}(\phi_{1})[n/x]$</p>
  
  <p>where $n=\min\{\ k\in\mathbb{N} : [k/x]\ \mbox{avoids capture for}\ {\cal M}(\phi_{1})\ \}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given a map $\sigma:V\to W$, its natural extension $\bar{\sigma}:V\oplus\mathbb{N}\to W\oplus\mathbb{N}$ (defined by $\bar{\sigma}(x)=\sigma(x)$ and $\bar{\sigma}(n)=n$) can act on the formula ${\cal M}(\phi)$ while avoiding capture. So $\bar{\sigma}\circ{\cal M}(\phi)$ is a meaningful formula which is our intended meaning for '$\sigma(\phi)$'. The problem is $\bar{\sigma}\circ{\cal M}(\phi)$ is a formula in ${\bf P}(W\oplus\mathbb{N})$ and not ${\bf P}(W)$. The trick is to show that provided $W$ is an infinite set or has cardinality no less than that of $V$, it is always possible to find a $\psi\in{\bf P}(W)$ such that $\bar{\sigma}\circ{\cal M}(\phi)={\cal M}(\psi)$. This formula $\psi$ is unique modulo $\alpha$-equivalence and is our candidate for $\sigma(\phi)$. I am not claiming to prove anything here, just sketching the ideas of what can be done to define a notion of: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Essential substitution</strong> $\sigma:{\bf P}(V)\to{\bf P}(W)$ associated with $\sigma:V\to W$, which is a map satisfying the key equality $\bar{\sigma}\circ{\cal M}={\cal M}\circ\sigma$ and behaves for all intent and purposes as a variable substitution mapping, while avoiding capture at all times. This map is essentially unique and can be re-defined modulo $\alpha$-equivalence while preserving its intended properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case when $W=V$ and $\sigma=[y/x]$ the existence of an essential substitution $[y/x]:{\bf P}(V)\to{\bf P}(V)$ is guaranteed and we seemingly have the object we need to finally write down specialization axioms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Specialization scheme:</strong></p>
  
  <p>$\forall x\phi_{1}\to\phi_{1}[y/x]$</p>
  
  <p>where $[y/x]:{\bf P}(V)\to{\bf P}(V)$ is  an essential substitution of $y$ in place of $x$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Going back to the case when $V=\{x,y\}$, $x\neq y$ and $\phi_{1}=\forall y(x\in y)$, taking $\sigma=[y/x]$ we see that $\bar{\sigma}\circ{\cal M}(\phi_{1})=\forall\,0(y\in 0)$ and consequently the only possible value for $\sigma(\phi_{1})$ is $\forall x(y\in x)$ and we can rejoice at the fact that $\forall x\forall y(x\in y)\to\forall x(y\in x)$ has now become an axiom. So:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question 3</strong>: Is anyone familiar with any alternative approach to this question of constructing <em>essential</em> substitution mapping $\sigma:{\bf P}(V)\to{\bf P}(W)$ associated with $\sigma:V\to W$ making a complete axiomatization possible?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This being said, despite having what I think are the right axioms, I still do not know if it can lead to a complete system (but this is already the object of another post <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/137485/embedding-of-consistent-subset-still-consistent-in-fol-finitely-many-variables"">Embedding of consistent subset in first order logic (finitely many variables)</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> some of the comments suggest that there is little point in considering finite variable fragments of FOL. After all, a closed formula (which is what we care most about) has only bound variables which are dummy names and do not matter modulo $\alpha$-equivalence. So whether we restrict these dummy names to be part of a finite set, or allow them to be chosen fresh at will, should not make any difference and is purely cosmetic. I completely agree with this of course and I am not suggesting there is anything interesting to be gained by seeing distinctions between dummy names. I perfectly accept that the interesting entities are congruence classes modulo $\alpha$-equivalence. but the fact remains: every formula of FOL needs a minimal number of variables to be expressed modulo $\alpha$-equivalence. The free algebra ${\bf P}(3)$ is the set of set theory statements which can be expressed with $3$ variables or less. There is a fundamental difference between ${\bf P}(0)$, ${\bf P}(1)$, ${\bf P}(2)$, ${\bf P}(3)$ and ${\bf P}(\mathbb{N})$. These are subsets of all statements of set theory which may be interesting in their own rights. In fact, there seems to be results about the classical decision problem being decidable in ${\bf P}(2)$ but not in ${\bf P}(3)$ (I may be saying something silly here, as I haven't yet checked the research, so please forgive me if my claim is inaccurate). Imagine we could code the Riemann Hypothesis in ${\bf P}(157)$ and the decision problem was decidable in ${\bf P}(n)$ for all $n\leq 160$. No one would question the pertinence of ${\bf P}(157)$. Unfortunately, this won't happen it seems...</p>

However, we have to be careful about the signatures involved. Monk assumes a language with equality, and a sequence of predicates with identical arity $n\geq 3$. He also crucially assumes that the number of variables is exactly equal to this common arity $n$. Thus, the question outlined in this post falls outside the scope of Monk's paper (since we have no equality, a single binary predicate and an arbitrary number of variables). So there is still hope that completeness can be achieved with the above specialization scheme (see <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/137485/embedding-of-consistent-subset-still-consistent-in-fol-finitely-many-variables"">Embedding of consistent subset in first order logic (finitely many variables)</a> for a full description of a possible deductive system involving that scheme).

<p>EDIT: I've replaced every instance of the predicate ""$Con$"" (consistency) with ""$Sat$"" (satisfiability); these are of course not equivalent over $RCA_0$, even though they are classically equivalent.</p>

<hr>

<p>Reverse mathematics studies the relative strength of theorems (in the language of second-order arithmetic) over the base theory $RCA_0$ which roughly corresponds to ""computable"" mathematics. A <em>separation</em> in reverse mathematics is a result of the form $$ RCA_0+A\not\models B, $$ where usually $ RCA_0+B\models A$; or equivalently $$Sat(RCA_0+A+\neg B).$$ In light of this latter form, it's easy to find true statements $A$ and $B$ such that $RCA_0+B\models A$ but $Sat(RCA_0+A+\neg B)$ cannot be proven from $RCA_0+Sat(RCA_0 + B)$; that is, the separation result is much harder to prove than the two statements being separated. This is what I mean by a ""hard"" separation.</p>

<p>However, I know of no natural examples of this phenomenon. So my first question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Q1) Are there natural theorems $A, B$ such that $Sat(RCA_0+A+\neg B)$ is not known to be provable in the weakest natural (from the point of view of reverse mathematics) axiom system which proves $A+B+Sat(RCA_0+B)$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A non-example: the result $WKL_0\not\models RT^2_2$ <em>can</em> be proved in $ACA_0$, which is the weakest natural system above $WKL_0$ which proves the satisfiability of both $WKL_0$ and $RT^2_2$.</p>

<p>The only candidate for a positive answer to (Q1) that I know of is the result (due to Francois Dorais and Jared Corduan; see <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1367"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1367</a> and <a href=""http://dorais.org/archives/827"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dorais.org/archives/827</a>) separating Weak Ramsey's Theorem and Hyper-Weak Ramsey's Theorem for pairs. The result uses a technique, ""envelope forcing,"" which seems technically complicated enough to require a strong system; however, although I have only glanced at this paper, it seems probable that the proof does in fact go through (perhaps modified) in $ACA_0$ and that $ACA_0$ is the weakest natural system proving Weak Ramsey's Theorem for Pairs and the satisfiability of Weak Ramsey's Theorem for Pairs. (Maybe Francois will weigh in on this?)</p>

<hr>

<p>A similar question exists for $\omega$-models:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Q2.1) Are there natural theorems $A, B$ such that ""$RCA_0+A+\neg B$ has an $\omega$-model"" is not known to be provable in the weakest natural (from the point of view of reverse mathematics) axiom system which proves $A+B+Sat(RCA_0+B)$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a slightly stronger version:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Q2.2) Are there natural theorems $A, B$ such that ""$RCA_0+A+\neg B$ has an $\omega$-model"" is not known to be satisfied in every $\omega$-model of the weakest natural axiom system which proves $A+B$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In natural cases, I suspect these are not really different from (Q1), but one never knows.</p>

<hr>

<p>We can also switch all the way from proofs to ""nice"" models. From a computability-theoretic perspective, the fact corresponding to the non-example of $WKL_0$ and $RT^2_2$ is that there is an $\omega$-model of $WKL_0+\neg RT^2_2$ consisting of $\Delta_2^0$ sets. The ""relativized"" version of this observation is that for any set $X\subseteq\omega$, there is an $\omega$-model of $WKL_0+\neg RT^2_2$ containing $X$ and consisting of sets which are all $\Delta^0_2$ in $X$; that is, bounded in any $\omega$-model of $ACA_0$ containing $X$. (Note that this does <em>not</em> automatically imply that every $\omega$-model of $ACA_0$ satisfies ""$WKL_0+\neg RT^2_2$ has an $\omega$-model, although this is true; the obstacle is that in principle these bounded models could be very complicated to describe.) From this perspective, it is natural to ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Q3) Are there natural theorems $A, B$, and a natural theory $T$ such that it is not known to be the case that for every $X\subseteq\omega$ and every $\omega$-model $\mathcal{M}$ of $T$ containing $X$, there is a set $Y\in \mathcal{M}$ and an $\omega$-model $\mathcal{N}$ of $A+\neg B$ with each set in $\mathcal{N}$ Turing below $Y$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I think it is this question which is most compelling, but I am biased.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, note that there's nothing special about $RCA_0$ here; the same sorts of questions can be asked over any base theory. Some natural base theories (at least for me) include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$ZFC$ (or $ZF$), or $ZFC$ ($ZF$) without Replacement, or without Powerset, etc.;</p></li>
<li><p>$KP$ or $KPU$, the theories of admissible sets;</p></li>
<li><p>Any of the theories in Buss' constellation of bounded arithmetic (e.g., $S_2^2$);</p></li>
<li><p>Alternative set theories, such as $NF$.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Q4) Are there natural separation results over one of these (or some other) base theory which are not known to be provable just using the base theory and the consistency and truth of both statements involved? (And similarly for the analogues of Q2.1, Q2.2, and Q3.)</p>

"<p>Weakening the axiom of naive comprehension has not been a popular way of escaping from the set-theoretic paradoxes because no consistent weakenings seem to be particularly well motivated or even to lead to understandable models.

This seems to me arguably in the spirit of restricting naive comprehension because comprehension is still the main set construction principle, and in particular there is no need for powerset or replacement.  Are there other ""natural"" examples of set theories that can be thought of as arrived at by weakening naive comprehension?  Perhaps ones that <i>don't</i> admit a universal set?</p>

<p>Even non-effective examples (examples where the set of instances of comprehension that is admitted is not computably enumerable) might be interesting.  Also, there might be interesting ways of weakening naive comprehension that are different from simply restricting the allowed instances of the schema.  For instance, maybe some set of disjunctions of instances of naive comprehension is interesting, or maybe it is interesting to consider an axiom that would only guarantee the existence of a set that is in some sense ""close"" to the class of objects satisfying $\phi$.</p>

<p>The context in which this question came up is that I was trying to explain Russell's paradox to someone, and their reaction was, well you should just throw out the instance of the comprehension axiom that leads to paradox.  Of course, throwing out literally that one instance won't restore consistency.  But pointing out a flaw in any particular proposal someone with this attitude toward the paradoxes might propose wouldn't show that some more sophisticated proposal might succeed.  I was hoping for some sort of general argument that, say, proceeding in this way inevitably leads to a system that is either like NF or like positive set theory (if it is not inconsistent or extremely weak).  (What else could be wrong with $x\notin x$ except that it is unstratified or that it involves negation?)  Or at least an argument that you won't get an extension of ZF by any natural weakening procedure would be nice!  Both NF and positive set theory, if I understand the situation aright, could serve as a foundation for mathematics, but both are less intuitive and convenient than ZFC, and it is sort of an article of faith for set theorists that any alternative to ZFC we might ever find is either somehow worse than ZFC or not deeply different from it, yes?</p>

"<p>Does there exist any rubric where <em>provably</em> transcendental real numbers emerge, in a meaningful way, as rare among <em>all</em> the transcendental numbers?</p>

<p>Here are some of the things I'm worried about:</p>

<p>1) To talk about provably transcendental numbers, it seems only fair to consider them as a subset of some sort of set of definable real numbers (relative to some appropriate language).  If the language is countable, that means comparing two countable sets, so measure-theoretic language doesn't seem to help.</p>

<p>2) Some transcendentality proofs naturally apply to all the numbers in a definable uncountable set (which of course contains many undefinable numbers).  Small variations of Liouville's famous original construction yield uncountable sets of transcendentals.  So a countable language that can only encode a countable number of proofs can still establish the transcendentality of more than countably many numbers.</p>

<p>Perhaps something like this: relative to a fixed language one can define a complexity for definable transcendental reals by the length of their shortest defining formula.  Among those of a given complexity, some fraction admit transcendentality proofs.  Perhaps this
fraction must go to 0 with the complexity for any reasonable theory?  (This seems to me a meaningful question despite that attendant undecibilities concerning whether a formula defines a numbers, whether two formulas define the same number, etc.)</p>

As A'3 is ane asy consequence of A3 (take w of A'3 to be t of A3), TG is a consequence of axiom A. So, to prove that TG is equivalent with A, it is sufficient to prove that A3 from TG.
from A1 and A2, we have that the power-set of x, P(x) is included inside y, and from A'3 that there exists a set w that is a member element of y such that P(x) is included inside w. And also, we have that P(w) is included inside y by A2. In view of A4, suppose that the set P(x) is equipotent with y. We then have an injection i from y into P(x), and as P(x) is included inside w we also have an injection j from y into w, and as P(w) is included inside y, the restriction k of j to the subset P(w) of y is an injection from P(w) to w.
But by Cantor's theorem, such an injection k does not exist, so a bijection between P(x) and y is impossible, and by A4, P(x) must be a member element of y, and A3 is proved from TG.</p>

"<p>In order to respond to concerns of impredicativity, Bertrand Russell developed a system of ramified second-order logic, which is like regular second-order logic except the comprehension schema is divided into levels.  The comprehension schema for level $0$ sets does not allow any formulas with second-order quantifiers.  For any natural number $n$, the comprehension schema for level $n+1$ sets allows quantification over sets of level $n$ and below.  This ensures that no set is defined using quantification over itself.  The resulting system, however, proved too weak to do much mathematics.  (Although it turns out it can do more than Russell assumed; see <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/150454/can-the-burgess-hazen-analysis-of-predicative-arithmetic-be-extended-to-transfin"">here</a>.)  So Russell adopted his controversial axiom of reducibility, actually an axiom schema which for each natural number $n$, states that for any set $X$ of level $n$, there exists a set $Y$ of level $0$ such that $X$ and $Y$ contain the same elements.</p>

<p>Now, it is commonly asserted that the axiom of reducibility is equivalent to simply eliminating the ramified hierarchy and just working in standard second-order logic.  But I don't see why.

Aren't there sets that aren't coextensional with sets of any level?</p>

<p>For background, Rice's Theorem
asserts essentially that no nontrivial question about computably enumerable sets is decidable. If W<sub>e</sub> is the set enumerated by program e, then the theorem states:</p>

<p><b>Rice's Theorem. </b> If A is a collection of computably
enumerable sets and { e |
W<sub>e</sub> &isin; A } is decidable, then either A is 
empty or A contains all computably enumerable sets.</p>

<p>In short, one can decide 
essentially nothing about a program e, if the answer is to
depend only on what the program computes rather than how it
computes it. </p>

<p>The question here is about the extent to which a similar
phenomenon holds for finitely presented groups, using the
analogy between programs and finite group presentations:</p>

<ul>
<li>a program e  is like a finite group presentation p</li>
<li>the set W<sub>e</sub> enumerated by e is like the group
&lang;p&rang; presented by p.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to this analogy, the analogue of Rice's theorem
would state that any decidable collection of finitely
presented groups (closed under isomorphism) should be either trivial or everything.
John Stillwell pointed out in answer to Chad Groft's
question that this is not true, because from a presentation
p we can easily find a presentation of the abelianization of
&lang;p&rang;, by insisting that all generators commute, 
and many nontrivial questions are decidable about finitely
presented abelian groups. Indeed, since the theory of
abelian groups is a decidable theory, there will be many
interesting questions about finitely presented abelian
groups that are decidable from their presentations. </p>

<p>My question is whether this is the only obstacle.</p>

<p><b>Question.</b> Does Rice's theorem hold for finitely
presented groups modulo abelianization? </p>

<p>In other words, if
A is a set of finitely presented groups (closed under
isomorphism) and the corresponding set of presentations { p | &lang;p&rang; &isin; A } is
decidable, then does A completely reduce to a question
about the abelianizations of the groups, in the sense that there is a set B of abelian groups such that G &isin; A iff Ab(G) &isin; B? </p>

<p>Of course, in this case B consists exactly of the abelian groups in A. The question is equivalently asking whether A respects the equivalence of groups having isomorphic abelianizations. In other words, must it be that G &isin; A iff Ab(G) &isin; A? 
The question is asking whether every decidable set of finitely presented groups amounts actually
to a decidable set of abelian groups, extended to all
finitely presented groups just by saturating with respect to abelianization. </p>

<p>In particular, the set A should contain either none or all perfect groups. </p>

<p>An affirmative answer would seem to provide a thorough
explanation of the pervasive undecidability phenomenon in
group presentations. But perhaps this may simply be too much to hope for...</p>

<p>In any event, I suppose that there is an equivalence relation on finite group presentations, saying that p &equiv; q just in case &lang;p&rang; and &lang;q&rang; have the same answer with repsect to any decidable question about finitely presented groups. The question above asks whether this equivalence relation is just Ab(&lang;p&rang;) = Ab(&lang;q&rang;). If this turns out not to be true, then what can be said about &equiv;?</p>

<p>Since $\alpha$ is irrational, the sequence $(x_{\alpha n})$ cannot be eventually constant, so $X_\alpha$ is infinite.

"<p>4-(suite): axiom A (or equivalently axiom TG) have powerfull consequences.
(i) It is easy to see that A1 and A2 prove the power-set axiom, by separation, because P(x is included inside the set y;
(ii)from A1 and iterations of A2, we also can derive the axiom of infinity. In fact all sets P(n,x), with P(0)=x, P(1,x)=P(x) and P(n+1, x)=P(P(n,x)) must be member elements of the set y and so are forming a set z by separation. But, by iteration of the Cantor's theorem, no injection from P(n+m,x) into P(n,x) is possible for m>0; so that all sets P(n,x) are distinct sets. We then have an injection from z into the class of finite ordinals, and by replacement this class must be a set, so that we prove the axiom of infinity.
(iii) It is also possible, but this is much more difficult and uses essentially the regularity axiom, to prove thecaxiom of choice from axiom A.
The three preceding proofs can be built so that we can prove that  the theory ""ZFC + Axiom A"" (or equivalently the theory ""ZFC + ""There exists a proper class of inaccessible cardinals"""")  is equivalent to the theory having as axioms: Replacement, Extensionality, Pair, Union and Regularity [and the axiom asserting the existence of some set , if this is not considered as a logical truth].
So, it seems that the price to be paid for deleting power-set, infinity and choice is to add the axiom of the Pair, but Tarski asserts that the Pair axiom can be derived from axiom A and replacement.

<p>Search problems can be interpreted as computational models (complexity classes), namely as polynomial time bounded computations plus an oracle solving instances of the search problem.</p>

<p>More formally, for example for linear orders:  Enhance a polynomial time bounded Turing machine $S$ with an oracle.  The oracle input always consists of a number $n$ and a code of another Turing machine $T$.  Machine $T$ (accepts pairs of integers and) computes an order relation $&lt;^L$ on integers from $0$ to $n$ and is constructed to guarantee termination in polynomial time.
The oracle then outputs a minimum number $m$ (that is, $0 \le m \le n$, and $(\forall x) 0 \le x \le n \implies  m &lt;^L x \vee m = x$).  In case the machine $T$ supplied to the oracle is invalid (not a Turing machine code, or defining a relation which is not a linear order up to $n$), the oracle is free to output any value.  Note that the size of $n$ is by definition polynomial in the size of the input to the Turing machine $S$, but its value may be exponential, and therefore the oracle may add computational power beyond polynomial time computable functions.</p>

<p>My question is: can this computation model (call it, $MIN^L$) solve $MIN^P$?</p>

<p>To further clarify, here is a trivial proof of the converse.   $S$ will get some $n$ and a code of a Turing machine.  It will simply feed both as $n$ and $T$ to its oracle, and output the oracle answer which is the desired minimum.</p>

<p>For example, if one partitions the integers into pairs and considers the group of all permutations that send pairs to pairs and respect the natural ordering on each pair then one gets a group of permutations isomorphic to the full permutation group. The age of the original structure does not have the SAP because it has non-trivial algebraicity (if you know where the bottom element of a pair goes, you know where the top element goes too). However, the full permutation group is the automorphism group of the empty structure which, of course, has the SAP.</p>

Let me quote them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The gradual rise of the opposing viewpoint, with its emphasis on conceptual
  reasoning and abstract characterization, is elegantly chronicled by Stein[110],
  as part and parcel of what he refers to as the “second birth” of mathematics.
  The following quote, from Dedekind, makes the diﬀerence of opinion very clear:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>A theory based upon calculation would, as it seems to me, not oﬀer
    the highest degree of perfection; it is preferable, as in the modern
    theory of functions, to seek to draw the demonstrations no longer
    from calculations, but directly from the characteristic fundamental
    concepts, and to construct the theory in such a way that it will, on
    the contrary, be in a position to predict the results of the calculation
    (for example, the decomposable forms of a degree).</p>

  investigation is to be preferred over calculation.</p>

Let's call this the <em>visible back-path</em> (VBP) condition. It can be proved using induction on the length of the path.</p>

<p>2) $\mathrm{M}$ corresponds to the <em>McKinsey</em> (McK) frame condition: for every partitioning of the set of worlds into two disjoint subsets, every world sees a world whose direct (immediate) successors lie all within the same partition. It can be proved by writing $\mathrm{M}$ as $\Diamond(\Box p \lor \Box \lnot p)$.</p>

<p>3) Consider a reflexive VBP frame that is not a frame for $\mathbf{Triv}$, i.e. there is a world $w$ that sees at least one world $w'$ distinct form itself.

Define a partitioning of the set of worlds into two subsets such that the first one includes $w$ and all the worlds $w'$ seen by $w$ for which $L_w(w')$ is even, the second one includes all the remaining worlds. Then the McK frame condition is not satisfied at $w$.</p>

Such a geometry will <em>not</em> have an isomorphism to hyperbolic or Euclidean incidence geometries even though Hilbert's axioms about incidence and between-ness will hold!  Indeed the incidence theory of such a quasi-Beltrami-Klein model actually determines $B$ up to an affine transformation.  (<strong>Has this fact been recorded in the literature?</strong>)</p>

<p><strong>Main Question:  Can one formulate a finite, or at least an elegant set of incidence and between-ness axioms, extending Hilbert's, so as to capture the theory of Euclidean and/or hyperbolic incidence?</strong></p>

<p>Added later: In light of Will Jagy's comment I'll sketch very briefly why I think the incidence geometry determines $B$ as much as it does, in case I'm obviously wrong.  Given $B$, one can decorate it in many way with three families of evenly spaced parallel chords with triple intersections wherever intersections occur.  The infinite of maximal configurations of this sort constitute approximations sufficient to recover $B$ up to affine. </p>

"<p>In this <a href=""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-0214-1_7"" rel=""nofollow"">Paper</a> of D. Isaacson, it is proved that the true arithmetic($Th(\mathbb{N}$)) is the only $\omega$-consistent and complete extension of $Q$ (Robinson's arithmetic). This, together with the fact that $Th(\mathbb{N})$ is not definable, immediately implies the following result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Proposition</strong>. If $T\supseteq Q$ is a $\omega$-consistent theory such that the set of (Godel numbers of ) axioms of $T$ is definable by a $\Sigma_n$ (or $\Pi_n$) formula (for some $n\in \mathbb{N}$), then $T$ is incomplete.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be proved that this incompleteness phenomenon is <em>essentially non-constructive</em>, which means that there is no computable function $f$ such that for every formula $\sigma(x)$ which defines the set of (Godel numbers of) axioms of an $\omega$-consistent theory $T$, then $f(\ulcorner\sigma(x)\urcorner)\downarrow=\theta$ and $\theta$ is a sentece independent from $T$. It is the case even when we restrict the problem to $\Sigma_4$ formulas. The idea of the proof is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$\omega$-consistency of a r.e. theory can be written as a $\Pi_3$ formula.
  By using the parametric version of the diagonal lemma, we can construct a formula $\psi(x)$ such that :
  $Q\vdash \psi(x)\equiv [f(\ulcorner \psi \urcorner)\downarrow \wedge \omega\text{-}con(Q+f(\ulcorner \psi \urcorner)) \wedge (x=q \vee x=f(\ulcorner \psi \urcorner))] \vee$
  $[f(\ulcorner \psi \urcorner)\downarrow \wedge \omega\text{-}con(Q+\neg f(\ulcorner \psi \urcorner)) \wedge (x=q \vee x=\neg f(\ulcorner \psi \urcorner))]\vee$ 
  $[x=q]$</p>
  
  <p>Where $q$ is the Godel number of conjunction of all axioms of $Q$. Now it is not hard to check that $\psi(x)$ is a $\Pi_3$ and then $\Sigma_4$ formula which defines a $\omega$-consistent theory $T_\psi$, but $f(\psi)$ is not independent from $T_\psi$ (see this <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02790"" rel=""nofollow"">preprint</a> for more details).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there is no computable $f$ with the desired property, even when we restrict the problem to $\Sigma_4$-definable theories. My question is about Turing degree of a function like $f$. Obviously one can enumerate the graph $f$ by oracle $0^{(4)}$ (because for a given $\Sigma_4$-definable theory, the problem of provability or refutability of a given sentence can be decided by oracle $0^{(4)}$). Hence it is a $0^{(4)}$-r.e. set, so its Turing degree is less that (or equal to) $0^{(5)}$. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is this Turing degree (necessarily) $0^{(5)}$ or it can be strictly less than $0^{(5)}$?</p>

"<p>It is well-known that the category of local rings and <em>ring</em> homomorphisms admits an axiomatisation in coherent logic. Explicitly, it is the coherent theory over the signature $0, 1, -, +, \times$ with the usual axioms for rings, plus the axioms
$$0 = 1 \vdash \bot$$
$$\top \vdash (\exists b . \; a \times b = 1) \lor (\exists b . \; (1 - a) \times b = 1)$$
See, for example, [<em>Sheaves in Geometry and Logic</em>, Ch. VIII, §6]. Unfortunately, because homomorphisms are only required to commute with the various things in the signature, the homomorphisms here are just ring homomorphisms and need not be local. It appears to me that the neatest way to fix this is to introduce a unary relation symbol $(\quad) \in \mathfrak{m}$, with the intention that $\mathfrak{m}$ is interpreted as the unique maximal ideal of the local ring. Then, by the usual rules for homomorphisms of models, a homomorphism $R \to R'$ must map elements of $\mathfrak{m}$ to elements of $\mathfrak{m}'$. But is there a way to axiomatise the theory so that</p>

<ol>
<li><p>we get a coherent, or at least geometric theory, and</p></li>
<li><p>the category of models in $\textbf{Set}$ is indeed the category of local rings and local ring homomorphisms, and</p></li>
<li><p>the structure sheaf homomorphism $f^\ast \mathscr{O}_{Y} \to \mathscr{O}_{X}$ of morphism of locally ringed spaces $X \to Y$ is a homomorphism in the category of models for this theory?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ideally, we'd like to define $\mathfrak{m}$ to be the subsheaf of nowhere invertible sections defined by
$$\{ s \in \mathscr{O} : \nexists t . \; s \times t = 1 \}$$
but unfortunately $\nexists t . \; s \times t = 1$ is not a geometric formula. (The formula $\forall t . \; s \times t \ne 1$ is equivalent to the previous one but has the same defect.) We can salvage one half of the biimplication as the geometric sequent
$$(a \in \mathfrak{m}) \land (\exists b . \; a \times b = 1) \vdash \bot$$
which merely expresses the requirement that ""$a$ is not in $\mathfrak{m}$ if $a$ is invertible"", but we also need to express the requirement that ""$a$ <em>is</em> in $\mathfrak{m}$ if $a$ is <em>not</em> invertible"". One possibility is the following:
$$\top \vdash (\exists b . \; a \times b = 1) \lor (a \in \mathfrak{m})$$
These two axioms appear to give the correct characterisation of $\mathfrak{m}$ in intuitionistic first order logic: it is easy to derive from these axioms that
$$a \in \mathfrak{m} \dashv \vdash \nexists b . \; a \times b = 1$$
so the interpretation of $\mathfrak{m}$ is completely determined by the axioms, at least in a topos. </p>

<p>But does every local ring object (in the sense of the first paragraph) admit an $\mathfrak{m}$ satisfying these axioms? The answer appears to be no, for the reason that these axioms assert that a every section of a sheaf of a local ring admits an open cover of the space by open sets on which the restriction is either invertible or nowhere invertible – and this is certainly not true in the contexts of interest. Can this idea be rescued with a more clever approach?</p>

"<p>Let me start with Helly's theorem: Let $A_1$, $A_2$, ..., $A_{n+2}$ be $n+2$ convex subsets of $\mathbb R^n$. If any $n+1$ of these subsets intersect (this means: have nonempty intersection), the so do all $n+2$.</p>

<p>This assertion is, logically speaking, a definite clause: All conditions are of the form ""some subsets intersect"", and so is the assertion. Generally, a definite clause about intersection of convex sets looks like this: Given some sets $S_1$, $S_2$, ..., $S_k$ and $T$ and a family $\left(F_a\right)_{a\in S_1\cup S_2\cup ...\cup S_k\cup T}$ of convex subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ indexed by the elements of $S_1\cup S_2\cup ...\cup S_k\cup T$, we claim that if every $i\in\left\lbrace 1,2,...,k\right\rbrace$ satisfies $\bigcap\limits_{a\in S_i}F_a\neq\emptyset$, then $\bigcap\limits_{a\in T}F_a\neq\emptyset$.</p>

<p>Now it is an easy exercise to see that every tautological (= true for every choice of convex subsets) definite clause about intersection of convex sets is derivable using trivial properties of intersection (such as $A\cap A=A$, $A\cap B=B\cap A$ and $A\cap \left(B\cap C\right)=\left(A\cap B\right)\cap C$) and Helly's theorem only. (Note that we consider $n$ as given a priori and fixed during our proof, so we can't project on a subspace and use Helly for a smaller $n$, for example. We really only can manipulate intersections and use Helly for various intersection of convex subsets. I could write up what we can do as a natural deduction system, but it is pretty obvious.)</p>

<p>Now, what if we allow indefinite clauses? These are statements of the form: Given some sets $S_1$, $S_2$, ..., $S_k$ and $T_1$, $T_2$, ..., $T_l$ and a family $\left(F_a\right)_{a\in S_1\cup S_2\cup ...\cup S_k\cup T_1\cup T_2\cup ...\cup T_l}$ of convex subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ indexed by the elements of $S_1\cup S_2\cup ...\cup S_k\cup T_1\cup T_2\cup ...\cup T_l$, we claim that if every $i\in\left\lbrace 1,2,...,k\right\rbrace$ satisfies $\bigcap\limits_{a\in S_i}F_a\neq\emptyset$, then at least SOME $j\in\left\lbrace 1,2,...,l\right\rbrace$ satisfies $\bigcap\limits_{a\in T_j}F_a\neq\emptyset$.</p>

<p>What set of ""axioms"" (such as Helly's theorem) do we need in order to prove such indefinite clauses, if they are tautological? By ""prove"" I mean prove without using the convexity of the sets or that the sets are set at all (a pointfree approach, so to speak) - only using formal properties of $\cap$, logic (let's say constructive) and these axioms. Obviously Helly alone is not enough anymore; for example, for $n=1$ we have this here: If $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ are four convex subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ such that $A\cap B$, $B\cap C$, $C\cap D$ and $D\cap A$ are nonempty, then at least one of the sets $A\cap C$ and $B\cap D$ are nonempty.</p>

"<p>This is a question which I suspect has an absurdly easy answer, but I'm not seeing it.</p>

<p>Let $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle:\omega^2\rightarrow\omega$ be your favorite pairing map (for me, this is the Cantor pairing function $(x, y)\mapsto{(x+y)(x+y+1)\over 2}+y$). Then, for $\mathcal{U}$ any ultrafilter on $\omega$, we can define a map $$m_\mathcal{U}: \mathcal{P}(\omega)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(\omega): X\mapsto\lbrace j: \lbrace i: \langle i, j\rangle\in X\rbrace\in \mathcal{U}\rbrace.$$ The intuition behind this, for me, is that we take $X$, decompose it into rows, and treat each row as a guess at a mysterious set $\hat{X}$. The actual set $\hat{X}$ is the set of all natural numbers $j$ such that ""most"" of the rows of $X$ guess that $j$ is in $\hat{X}$. Topologically speaking, these maps are very badly behaved (unless $\mathcal{U}$ is principal of course); I don't know of any good picture of them besides this guessing idea.</p>

<p>This lets $\mathcal{U}$ act on collections of sets of natural numbers: for $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(\omega)$, let $$\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{C})=\lbrace m_\mathcal{U}(X): X\in\mathcal{C}\rbrace.$$ Mild closure properties of $\mathcal{C}$ imply that for all ultrafilters $\mathcal{U}$, we have $\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{C})\supseteq\mathcal{C}$; in the other direction, it is easy to construct, for any ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ and any $\mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(\omega)$, a $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(\omega)$ such that $\mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{C})=\mathcal{C}$. </p>

<p>I'm playing around with these maps for the heck of it; I don't know of any mathematical significance they have (although I'd be very interested if someone could point me towards a source where they're already studied). While fooling around, I ran into the following question:</p>

<p>Let $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(\omega)$. Say that an ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $\omega$ is <em>definable in $\mathcal{C}$</em> if $\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{C})=\mathcal{C}$ and there is some formula $\phi$ with parameters from $\mathcal{C}\cup\omega$ and two free set variables $\phi(X, Y)$ in the language of second-order arithmetic such that $$\forall A, B\in\mathcal{C}, m_\mathcal{U}(A)=B\iff (\omega,\mathcal{C})\models\phi(A, B).$$ (In this case, say $\mathcal{U}$ is definable in $\mathcal{C}$ via $\phi$) My question is this:</p>

<p>(*) What are the $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{U}$ such that $\mathcal{U}$ is definable in $\mathcal{C}$?</p>

<p>Principal ultrafilters are definable in reasonable $\mathcal{C}$, but I can't ""construct"" an example of any non-principal ultrafilter being definable in any $\mathcal{C}$ that isn't stupid (say, $\mathcal{C}=\lbrace A\rbrace$, $m_\mathcal{U}(A)=A$, so $\phi(X, Y)\equiv X=Y$); on the other hand, I have no reason to believe that nontrivial examples don't exist.</p>

<p>There is also the stronger notion of <em>extendible definability</em>: An ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ is <em>extendibly definable in $\mathcal{C}$</em> if for some formula $\phi$, $\mathcal{U}$ is definable in $\mathcal{C}$ via $\phi$ and for all $\mathcal{D}\supseteq\mathcal{C}$, there is some $\mathcal{E}\supseteq \mathcal{D}$ such that $\mathcal{U}$ is definable in $\mathcal{E}$ via $\phi$. For instance, every principal ultrafilter is extendibly definable in any sufficiently closed $\mathcal{C}$.</p>

<p>The differences are:
- PRA uses recursive definition with a descending parameter. While PCA uses closures.
- PRA has functions that have always exactly one result. In PCA there are relations, that may have no results (for instance in case of an endless loop) or multiple.
- In PRA every theory consists of the equality of two primitive recursive functions (e.g. F(x) = G(x)). In PCA it consists of an inequality of two relations (e.g. F(x,y) => G(x,y)).</p>

<p>The similarities are that you always compare two functions/relations and that it is logic free. No logical symbols, no quantifiers, no 'and', no 'or' etc. The boolean operators must first be defined.</p>

<p>PCA is more expressive than PRA. For instance, you can not express that there are infinite prime numbers in PRA, but you can in PCA. Still PCA is finitistic, because it has only potential infinite, but no actual infinite (it doesn't have a infinite set).</p>

<p>PCA might be interested for proving correctness of programs. Loops without a descending variable can easily be translated to a closure, but not to PRA. 
But of course, you need to have some sort of love for weak systems.</p>

<p>My question is, for my further research, does something like the system I described already exists? Before I continue with this, I want to be sure that I don't re-inventing something. In my search I already did, I couldn't find something in this direction.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Edit, a more formal description of the language.</p>

<p>Value-expressions consists of 0 or variables, $x$, $x_1$, $x_2$, $y$, etc.</p>

<p>There are two pre-defined predicate, the equality:</p>

<p>$$
x = y
$$</p>

<p>And the successor operator $y = x + 1$:</p>

<p>$$
s(y, x)
$$</p>

<p>A new predicate can be defined, by the conjunction of predicates already defined. For instance, a relation that adds two can be defined as follows:</p>

<p>$$
AddTwo(y, x) := s(y, z), s(z, x)
$$</p>

<p>Any variable that appears on the right side, but not on the left side, is existential automatically (in the example above the variable $z$).</p>

<p>You can take transitive reflexive closure of any predicate with an even number of parameters. In this way, the natural numbers can be given in a ""potential infinite"" way:</p>

<p>$$
N(x) := s^*(x, 0)
$$</p>

<p>Closures can also be used in defining new predicates. If the predicate contains more than 2 variables, then the closure is over multiple variables at once. The even variables are connected to the odd ones. In this way the addition relation can be defined ($z = x + y$):</p>

<p>$$
PlusMinus(y, x, w, v) := s(y, x), s(v, w)
$$
$$
Add(z, x, y) := PlusMinus^*(z, x, y, 0), N(x)
$$</p>

<p>A theorem is a comparison of two predicates:
$$
Even(x) := AddTwo^*(x, 0)
$$
$$
N(x) \Leftarrow Even(x)
$$
Which says that the even numbers are a subset of the natural numbers. The $\Leftarrow$ is preferred over $\Rightarrow$ because it is more convenient when making proofs.</p>

<p>The main axiom scheme is of replacement. The right side of a theorem can be made stronger (more restrictive). </p>

<p>There are more axioms, but the most interesting is the inductive scheme. The scheme is not on numbers, but on the closure:</p>

<p>$$
H(x, y) := F(x, z), G(z, y)
$$
$$
H'(x, y) := F(x, z), G^*(z, y)
$$
If:
$$
F(x, y) \Leftarrow H(x, y)
$$
Then:
$$
F(x, y) \Leftarrow H'(x, y)
$$</p>

<p>Where $x$, $y$ and $z$ can also be multiple variables. In plain English it says, that if applying a certain relation does not alter a property, then the property is also not altered if applied multiple times (the closure).</p>

<p>I hope this outlines the system in it most basic form. The complete axioms and schemes are of course more elaborate. </p>

One (to me, not apparently useful) set that one cannot build in ETCS is $\coprod_{n\in \mathbb{N}} P^n(\mathbb{N})$. <a href=""https://mathematicswithoutapologies.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/does-mathematics-without-apologies-have-a-real-author/comment-page-1/#comment-410"">Jacob Lurie pointed out</a> on Michael Harris' blog<sup>1</sup> the example of taking a Banach space $V$ and considering the colimit of the sequence $V \to V^{**}\to V^{*4} \to \cdots$. <a href=""https://mathematicswithoutapologies.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/does-mathematics-without-apologies-have-a-real-author/comment-page-1/#comment-424"">Yemon Choi responded</a> to a foolish suggestion of mine that this sequence (or rather, the related cosimplicial object) is in fact of use.</p>

<p>This got me to thinking that from a category-theoretic point of view, we are used to not having enough colimits (say in geometric settings, like schemes, manifolds, and so on) or limits (for instance in settings like finite groups etc), and this is deftly sidestepped by using a colimit completion. One can consider ind-schemes, or differentiable stacks, etc etc. Why should ETCS be any different, apart from intending to be the primordial category?</p>

<p>What stops me from working, when I need to, in a slightly larger category that is in a sense a colimit-completion of an ETCS category, with the understanding that most of the time I'm interested in objects in my original category, but sometimes constructions I'm interested in sit outside it? The original example above is perfectly well represented as the sequence $k\mapsto \coprod_{0\leq n\leq  k} P^n(\mathbb{N})$, with the obvious inclusions between them.</p>

<p>Note that I'm not asking that arbitrary objects in the completed category are necessarily the stuff of ordinary mathematics, or that the completed category is a topos, or a model of ETCS. But what can go wrong with this approach? What are the usual uses of Replacement in ""ordinary mathematics"" (almost anything that's not ZFC-and-friends) that could/couldn't be sorted by the method proposed above?</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> The context of the discussion was the effect on ordinary mathematics the discovery that ZFC was inconsistent. Tom Leinster argues (and I agree) that the most likely culprit would be Replacement, since the rest of ZFC is essentially equivalent to ETCS, and the axioms of ETCS encode the operations on sets that underly day-to-day practice of people who aren't set theorists.</p>

<p>[EDIT: On reflection, I'm putting words into Tom's mouth a little here. The actual point he has made is that <em>if</em> a contradiction were found with using Replacement, it wouldn't affect most mathematicians, but it a contradiction were found in ETCS (equivalently, BZC) then we could start to worry. If we assume that 'ordinary' mathematics is consistent, as it seems to be, then one might make the---justified or not---leap that a little-used axiom is the place a contradiction might be found, if one existed. As others have pointed out in the comments below, Comprehension is also a contender for a 'risky' axiom.]</p>

"<p><strong>Short version</strong>: what can we say about the place of idempotent ultrafilters in the Rudin-Keisler ordering?</p>

<p><strong>Longer version</strong>:</p>

<p>If $U$, $V$ are (nonprincipal) ultrafilters on $\omega$, then we write $U\ge_{RK}V$ in case there is some function $f:\omega\rightarrow\omega$ such that $$ \forall X\subseteq\omega,\quad f^{-1}(X)\in U\iff X\in V.$$</p>

<p>An ultrafilter $U$ is <em>Ramsey</em> if given any two-coloring of pairs $c: [\omega]^2\rightarrow 2$, there is a homogeneous set for $c$ in $U$. Equivalently, $U$ is Ramsey if whenever $\lbrace C_n\rbrace_{n\in\omega}$ is a partition of $\omega$ with each $C_n\not\in U$, there is some $H\in U$ such that for all $n\in\omega$, $$\vert H\cap C_n\vert=1.$$ An ultrafilter $U$ is <em>idempotent</em> if $U\oplus U=U$, where $$ V\oplus W=\lbrace X: \lbrace x: \lbrace y: x+y\in X \rbrace \in W \rbrace \in V\rbrace.$$ Idempotent ultrafilters can be proved to exist in $ZFC$: this amounts to showing that $\oplus$ is left-continuous and associative on the compact space $\beta\mathbb{N}$, and then applying Ellis' theorem that every left-continuous semigroup on a compact space has an idempotent element. By contrast, Ramsey ultrafilters cannot be shown to exist in $ZFC$, although their existence is equiconsistent with $ZFC$ (in particular, if the Continuum Hypothesis - or weaker statements - holds, then there are Ramsey ultrafilters).</p>

<p>Now, an easy argument shows that no Ramsey ultrafilter is idempotent. On the other hand, the Ramsey ultrafilters enjoy a special property with respect to the RK-ordering: they are precisely the RK-minimal ultrafilters. So combining these facts shows that no idempotent ultrafilter can be RK-minimal.</p>

<p>My question is, what else can be said about the idempotent ultrafilters in terms of RK-reducibility? For example, can we have an idempotent ultrafilter U with exactly one RK-class of (necessarily, Ramsey) ultrafilters strictly RK-below U? This seems clearly impossible, but I don't see how to prove it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Motivation: a few weeks ago, I taught a one-week course on the proof of Hindman's theorem from additive combinatorics using idempotent ultrafilters. On the last day, I talked a bit about other types of ultrafilters, and spent a bit of time defining Ramsey ultrafilters and explaining (not proving) their place in the RK-ordering. One of my students asked whether anything similar could be said about idempotent ultrafilters; besides the obvious, I couldn't come up with anything, so I'm asking here.</p>

"<p>It is well known that every partial order on a set can be extended
to a linear order on that set. That is, for every partial order
$\lhd$ on a set $X$, there is a linear order $\prec$ on $X$ such
that ${\lhd}\subseteq\prec$, meaning $a\lhd b\implies a\prec b$. In the
most general case, with uncountable $X$, one appeals to Zorn's
lemma. For relations on $\mathbb{N}$, however, the linearization
process is effective. My question concerns the relative complexity
of such linearizations $\prec$ in comparison with the original
order $\lhd$. (See also Jirka Hanika's
related question on <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/89527/is-minp-search-problem-partial-order-reducible-to-minl-linear-order-sea"">reducing minimal element search for partial orders to that of linear orders</a> in the
case of finite orders.)</p>

<p><b>Question.</b> Does every polynomial time decidable partial order
relation $\lhd$ on $\mathbb{N}$ extend to a polynomial time
decidable linear order relation on $\mathbb{N}$?</p>

<p>I expect not. I think there will be a polynomial time decidable
partial order relation on $\mathbb{N}$ that does not extend to any
polynomial time linear order. The reason I believe so is that the
natural method of constructing a linear order extending a given
partial order seems to proceed fundamentally in series rather than
parallel, in the sense that one gradually linearizes increasing
portions of the partial order, but one must keep track of what one
did earlier, in order not to conflict with later decisions. But
with a polynomial time construction, one cannot afford to inspect
the earlier parts of the linearization.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, every computable partial order $\lhd$ on $\mathbb{N}$
does extend to a computable linear order $\prec$ on $\mathbb{N}$, and this is what I meant when I said that linearizaton is effective, by
the following procedure: at stage $n$, we know how the numbers up
to $n$ relate with respect to $\lhd$ and we have built the desired
relation $\prec$ on the numbers below $n$. The new number $n$
divides this linear order into those that are $\lhd$-below $n$,
incomparable to $n$, and $\lhd$-above $n$. We may now proceed to
linearize $n$ into the order by placing $n$ as high as possible,
say, above all the nodes so far to which it is incomparable, if
any. This recursive procedure produces a linear order extending
$\lhd$.</p>

<p>The point for the question is that this algorithm seems to require
an exponential increase in the time complexity, since on a given
input one must construct the relation on all nodes up to that node
before knowing what to do, and this takes exponential time. Indeed,
it isn't even clear whether one should be able to find a
linearization in the class NP.</p>

<p><b>Question.</b> Does every polynomial time partial order extend to
an NP linear order?</p>

<p>I expect not, since even a polynomial size certificate seems
insufficient in general to track the linearization construction,
which has exponential size.</p>

<p>Finally, let me point out that the analogue at the level of c.e.
orders attains the negative result.</p>

<p><b>Theorem.</b> There is a c.e. partial order $\lhd$ on
$\mathbb{N}$ that does not extend to any c.e. linear order on
$\mathbb{N}$.</p>

<p>Proof. Part of the point is that every c.e. linear order is
actually decidable. Let $A,B\subset\mathbb{N}$ be computable
inseparable c.e. sets, meaning that they are disjoint c.e. sets and
there is no decidable set containing $A$ and disjoint from $B$.
Define the partial order $\lhd$ by placing every element of $A$
below $0$ and $0$ below every element of $B$, but otherwise
elements are incomparable. This is a c.e. relation, since given two
numbers $a$ and $b$, we can say how they are related once they are
enumerated into $A$ or $B$, and otherwise they are unrelated. But
if the relation extends to a linear order $\prec$ on $\mathbb{N}$,
then the set of $\prec$-predecessors of $0$ will be a computable
separation of $A$ and $B$, a contradiction. QED</p>

answer the main question?</p>

"<p>It is a trivial fact that forcing can not produce finite sets of ground model objects. However there are situations, 
where we can use forcing to prove the existence of finite objects with some properties. For example consider the following 
result of Shelah (I learned this example from the answer given by Prof. Komjath in <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/29945/forcing-as-a-tool-to-prove-theorems"">Forcing as a tool to prove theorems</a>):</p>

  <p><strong>Theorem (Shelah)</strong> There exists  a finite $K_4$-free graph which, when the edges colored by $2$ colors, always contains a 
  monocolored triangle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shelah's proof of the theorem is simply as follows: 
He constructs a forcing extension which adds a graph $X$ with the same property but 
with $\aleph_0$ colors. Then $X$ has the edge-coloring property for $2$ colors, 
as well. Then using compactness theorem, $X$ must contain a finite subgraph $Y$ with the same property.
 As forcing cannot create new finite graphs, $Y$ is already present 
in the ground model.  By Godel, $ZFC$ proves that there is such a graph. </p>

<p>Now my question is that if there are more examples of the above kind. To be more precise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question 1.</strong> Are there any other examples for producing some finite object $Y$ (with some properties)
  in the following way:</p>
  
  <p>1) We provide a suitable generic extension in which there is an infinite object $X$ with the required properties,</p>
  
  <p>2) By compactness (or other devices), we can conclude that there must be a finite subset $Y$ of $X$ with the same properties,</p>
  
  <p>3) So we can conclude that the object must exist in the ground model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Remark 1.</strong> I am mostly interested in examples where it is not known (or it is difficult) to produce such finite object directly</p>

<p><strong>Remark 2.</strong> It seems that some partition type theorems are of this type: It is possible to derive some kind of 
finite partition theorems (like finite Ramsey theorem) using infinite versions of them. So if we can prove 
the infinite version of these partition theorems, then we have produced examples of the required type 
(there are cases where we can prove infinite partition theorems using forcing). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question 2.</strong> Is Shelah's result the first non-trivial example of an answer to question 1? Are there othe non-trivial constructions of the above kind before him?</p>

"<p>It has been known for some time that one can define a topos as a model of a (finitary) essentially algebraic theory (or in other words, can be defined internal to any category with finite limits). In particular, given a topos $E$ (for instance the topos of sets) one can define an internal topos in $E$ (e.g. a small topos). One can ask for stronger (and in fact is easier to define) in an internal <em>universe</em>: this is a category theoretic analogue of a Grothendieck universe. Such a thing gives rise to an internal topos $M$ in $E$ that is in addition a <em>locally full subcategory</em>. The nontechnical definition is that there is an $E$-object $e(x)$ of $M$-elements of any $M$-object $x$ (recall that elements are functions $1 \to x$, here taken in $M$), and (the $E$-object of) functions <em>in $E$</em> between $e(x)$ and $e(y)$ correspond to the $E$-object of functions <em>in $M$</em> between $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>There are toposes, given a metatheory of $ZFC$, that have no universes in this sense, namely the topos of sets in $V_{\omega+\omega}$, much like one cannot prove the existence of Grothendieck universes in vanilla ZFC. </p>

<p>What I'm curious about is the existence of internal toposes that <em>aren't</em> locally full (equivalently, arise from universes). Shouldn't we get the <em>free internal topos</em> in a topos?

<p>If that doesn't make sense my next questions probably do not either.</p>

<p>2 The category of sheaves on the big zariski site forms a topos T, the category of schemes being a subcategory. It is convenient to reason about toposes in their own ""internal logic"". Has there been much thought done about the internal logic of T, or would the logic of T require too much commutative algebra to feel like logic?  Along these lines, have there been attempts to write down an elementary list of axioms which capture the essense of this topos?

"<h2>Background</h2>

<p>An ordinal $\alpha$ is called a <em>recursive ordinal</em> if there is a recursive well-order $R$ on $\mathbb{N}$ such that ordertype($\mathbb{N},R) = \alpha$.  For example, $\omega\cdot 2$ is a recursive ordinal because the ordering of $\mathbb{N}$ as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,  ... 1, 3, 5, 7, ... is computable and has order type $\omega\cdot 2$.</p>

<p>Kleene encoded the recursive ordinals in the natural numbers in a nifty way which is described at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_O"" rel=""nofollow"">the Wikipedia page on Kleene's O</a>.  Now Kleene's $\mathcal{O}$ is a fairly powerful set -- given a Turing machine index for a linear order, $\mathcal{O}$ can decide whether that ordering is a well-ordering or not.</p>

<p>Using Kleene's $\mathcal{O}$, it is possible to describe how to iterate the Turing jump through the recursive ordinals.  For each natural number $a\in\mathcal{O}$, we can define a set $H_a$ recursively as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>$H_a = \emptyset$ if $a=0$</li>
<li>$H_a = {H_b}'$ if $a=2^b$</li>
<li>$H_a = \{\langle n, x \rangle | x \in H_{\phi_e(n)} \}$ if $a = {3\cdot 5^e}$</li>
</ol>

<p>For each $a\in \mathcal{O}$, we have $H_a$ &lt;$_T \ \mathcal{O}$ (strict inequality), and no $H_a$ is powerful enough to decide which recursive orders are well-orders.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Among recursive non-well-orders, some hide their descending chains better than others do.  </p>

<p>For example, if we only wanted to flag the non-well-orders sporting a <em>recursive</em> descending chain, the full power of $\mathcal{O}$ would not be necessary -- $\emptyset'''$ would do $(\exists e [ \phi_e$ is total and $\forall n [\ \phi_e(n+1)$ &lt;$_R\ \phi_e(n)\ ]]$?).  Thus there is a recursive linear non-well-order with no recursive descending chain.  </p>

<p>In fact (by similar reasoning), for each $a \in \mathcal{O}$ there must be a recursive linear non-well-order with no recursive-in-$H_a$ descending chain.</p>

<p>I wonder whether we could effectively construct these sneaky recursive non-well-orders.</p>

  <p>Is there a recursive function $f$ such that whenever $a\in\mathcal{O}$, $f(a)$ is a Turing index for a linear non-well-order with no $H_a$ -computable descending chain?</p>

"<p><strong>Background.</strong> The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church-Turing_thesis"">Church-Turing thesis</a>, in one of its many equivalent formulations, states that the intuitively computable arithmetical functions are exactly those computed by Turing machines.</p>

<p>According to Alan Turing’s classic paper <a href=""http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/s2-42/1/230"">On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem</a>, “intuitively computable” refers to a human computer having access to enough scratch paper to hold the intermediate results.</p>

<p>This thesis has been extremely successful among logicians first (including <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=qW8x7sQ4JXgC&amp;pg=PA72"">Kurt Gödel</a>), and computer scientists later; some authors even extended it to include all functions that can be computed by any <a href=""http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/54/2/181"">effectively realizable physical system</a>.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the Church-Turing thesis is, at least in principle, falsifiable: it is enough to describe a non Turing-computable function admitting another kind of computation procedure, executable by the above-mentioned human computer. Of course, no such function is known to exist; however, consider the following “weaker computability thesis” for the sake of argument:</p>

  <p>Every intuitively computable arithmetical function is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function"">primitive recursive</a>.</p>

"<p>first,I think we can avoid set theory to bulid the first order logic ,  by the operation of the finite string.but I have  The following questions:</p>

<p>How does ""meta-logic"" work. I don't really know this stuff yet, but from what I can see right now, meta-logic proves things about formal languages and logics in general. But does it use some logic to do so? Like if I want to prove that two formal languages are equivalent in some respect, aren't I presupposing a ""background"" formal language? And won't my choice of a ""background"" (meta) language affect what I can and can't demonstrate? For example,  what logic was Godel using when he proved his famous theorems? Was it a bivalent one? A three valued logic? etc</p>

<p>In short,I'm still not sure how reasoning about all possible formal languages work. For example, suppose I say something of the form ""for all formal theories, F, if F has property X, then F must have property Y"". If I wanted to prove something like that, how does such very general reasoning work? What I mean is that in such a proof, what kind of logic would be employed (for example, would it be a two valued logic?), and does the choice of logic affect the outcome? Do logicians agree on some kind of meta-meta logic, which they use to reason about absolutely everything? Or do they just choose their favorite one?</p>

<p>if metalogic is just predicate logic,It seems circular to me! we build the theory of predicate logic by using predicate logic?For example, in proving some theorem in the object language we seem to assume that it is already correct (in the metalanguage). Or defining some connective in the object language, we use that connective in the metalanguage to do so. It's like they're saying ""Alright guys! We are going to prove a bunch of stuff about logic! Oh, by the way, you have to take all this stuff we are about to prove for granted, but don't worry, that's just the ""metalanguage""."" Something about this seems wrong to me.

"<p>I want to understand the idea of the proof of the artihmetic fixed point theorem. The theorem is crucial in the proof of Gödel's first Incompletness theorem.</p>

<p>First some notation: We work in $NT$, the usual number theory, it has implemented all primitve recursive functions. Every term or formula $F$ has a unique Gödel number $[F]$, which encodes $F$. If $n$ is a natural number, the corresponding term in $NT$ is denoted by $\underline{n}$. The function $num(n):=[\underline{n}]$ is primitive recursive. Also, there is a primitive recursive function $sub$ of two variables, such that $sub([F],[t])=[F_v(t)]$, where $v$ is a free variable of $F$ which is replaced by a term $t$.</p>

This is apparently an open question, but I realized after some thought that I don't know how to prove it is decidable in ZFC.</p>

<p>If the number is not an integer, this can be proved in ZFC, because that fact could be expressed by an arithmetical sentence saying there is an integer $n$ such that the sum of a certain definable series is greater than $n$ and less than $n+1$. This sentence can be seen to be $\Sigma^0_1$ by standard techniques, and any true $\Sigma^0_1$ sentence is provable in ZFC. </p>

<p>But if the sum is an integer, it does not seem obvious that this must be provable in ZFC. In general, only $\Sigma^0_1$ statements have to be provable if they are true, and the claim that a certain definable series sums to an integer is $\Sigma^0_2$ rather than $\Sigma^0_1$. </p>

<p>Moreover, it's not hard to see that there are definitions of sequences $(a_n)$ in ZFC such that ZFC proves that $\sum a_n$ converges but ZFC doesn't prove this sum is an integer and ZFC doesn't prove it is not an integer. These sequences can be constructed using the incompleteness theorem in the usual way. In fact, we can make $0 \leq a_n \leq 2^{-n}$ for all $n$, so there is no issue with the rate of convergence. </p>

"<p>In Calculus we teach that if the $a_n$ are positive and decreasing with limit equal to zero, then the alternating series $\sum_n (-1)^na_n$ converges. One can in general not leave out the assumption that the $a_n$ (eventually) decrease, as the example $a_{2n}:=1/n$ and $a_{2n+1}:=1/2^n$ shows. However, most examples are series where the $a_n$ are given by some function $a_n=f(n)$ (for $n\gg 0$). </p>

For instance, any o-minimal class will work, since any $f$ with limit zero at infinity must eventually be decreasing. But I think if we add the sine function to this class and close under addition, multiplication and composition, this is still true. In fact, I would almost dare to postulate that the class of elementary functions (i.e., the ones our students work with), have this property, and so we do not need to ``bug'' them with this extra condition.</p>

"<p>(For simplicity, the background theory for this post is NBG, a set theory directly treating proper classes which is a conservative extension of ZFC.)</p>

<p>Vopenka's Principle ($VP$) states that, given any proper class $\mathcal{C}$ of structures in the same (set-sized, relational) signature $\Sigma$, there are some distinct $A, B\in\mathcal{C}$ such that $A$ is isomorphic to an elementary substructure of $B$. In terms of consistency, we have the following rough upper and lower bounds: $$\text{proper class of extendibles $\le$ Vopenka's Principle $\le$ almost huge.} $$ (I don't know if this is state-of-the-art; more precise bounds, if known, would be welcome!) Thus, even though on the face of it $VP$ does not directly talk about cardinals, it is generally thought of as a large cardinal axiom.</p>

<p>Now, abstract model theory appears to give a framework for generalizing VP. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be any regular logic$^*$; then we can study ""Vopenka's Principle for $\mathcal{L}$,"" $VP(\mathcal{L})\equiv$ ""For any proper class $\mathcal{C}$ of $\Sigma$-structures ($\Sigma$ a set-sized relational signature), there are distinct $A, B\in\mathcal{C}$ with $A$ $\mathcal{L}$-elementarily embeddable into $B$."" So, for example, taking $\mathcal{L}_I$ to denote first-order logic, $VP$ is just $VP(\mathcal{L}_I)$.</p>

<p>In principle, the resulting principles could have wildly varying large cardinal strengths. In practice, however, this seems to be extremely false.</p>

<p><strong>Weaker Versions:</strong> Harvey Freidman has proved (see <a href=""http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2005-August/009023.html"">http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2005-August/009023.html</a>) that $VP(\mathcal{L}_I)$ is equivalent to the statement that given any appropriate proper class $\mathcal{C}$ of structures, there are distinct $A$, $B\in\mathcal{C}$ such that $A$ is embeddable (NOT elementarily) into $B$. So $VP(\mathcal{L}_I)$ is equivalent to VP for the quantifier-free fragment of first-order logic.</p>

<p><strong>Stronger Versions:</strong> Two reasonable logics to look at for stronger versions of $VP$ are $\mathcal{L}_{II}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1\omega}$, second-order and (the smallest standard) infinitary logic respectively. However, the corresponding Vopenka principles are still just as strong as $VP(\mathcal{L}_I)$.$^{**}$ In general, $VP(\mathcal{L}_I)$ seems to be an upper bound for Vopenka's Principles for locally set-sized, definable logics. Since non-definable logics are of limited interest, it's reasonable to look at class-sized logics. The tamest class-sized logic I know of is $\mathcal{L}_{\infty\omega}$, the infinitary logic allowing arbitrary set-sized Boolean combinations but no infinite strings of quantifiers. However, $VP(\mathcal{L}_{\infty\omega})$ is inconsistent: by a famous theorem of Carol Karp, two structures are $\mathcal{L}_{\infty\omega}$-equivalent if and only if they are back-and-forth equivalent, so the class $\mathcal{O}$ of all ordinals (regarded as linear orderings) is a counterexample in any model of $ZFC$.</p>

<p>This all suggests that there are probably no interesting versions of Vopenka's Principle stronger than the usual one, and that any weaker form of Vopenka has to come from a horribly weak - to the point of being probably uninteresting - logic. I find this kind of disappointing. So, my question is:</p>

<p>$^*$ The definition of ""regular logic"" is long and tedious, but it can be found in Ebbinghaus and Flum's book ""Mathematical Logic"" (Definitions 12.1.2 and 12.1.3). For this post, the details don't really matter; the key points are that the structures considered are the same as for first-order logic, and that everything is classical (i.e., two truth values).</p>

<p>$^{**}$ The proof for $\mathcal{L}_{II}$ goes as follows. Suppose $V\models VP(\mathcal{L}_I)$, and let $\mathcal{C}\in V$ be a proper class of structures in a set-sized relational signature $\Sigma$. Let $\Sigma'$ be the signature consisting of $\Sigma$ together with a new unary relation symbol $S$ and a new binary relation symbol $E$. In $V$, we can construct the class $\mathcal{C}'$ of structures of the form $$ A':= A\sqcup (\mathcal{P}(A)\times\lbrace A\rbrace), \quad  S^{A'}=\mathcal{P}(A)\times\lbrace A\rbrace, \quad E^{A'}=\lbrace (a, b): a\in A, b=(X, A), a\in X\rbrace  $$ for $A\in\mathcal{C}$. Now second-order quantification over a structure in $\mathcal{C}$ can be replaced with first-order quantification over the $S$-part of the corresponding structure in $\mathcal{C}'$. So if $A'$ is first-order elementarily embeddable into $B'$, $A$ must be second-order elementarily embeddable into $B$, so since $V\models VP(\mathcal{L}_I)$ we're done. The proof for $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1\omega}$ follows similar lines.</p>

"<p>I am trying to understand why induction up to exactly $\epsilon_0$ is necessary to prove the cut-elimination theorem for first-order Peano Arithmetic; or, as I understand, equivalently, why the length of a PA-proof with all cuts eliminated grows (in the worst case) as fast as $f_{\epsilon_0}$ in the fast-growing hierarchy.</p>

<p>I can understand why use of an induction axiom corresponds to ordinal multiplication by $\omega$.  As induction axioms are written in the sequent calculus, as a premise we have a proof of $\phi(x)\vdash\phi(Sx)$ for a free variable $x$, and as a conclusion we get $\phi(0)\vdash\phi(y)$ for any term $y$.</p>

<p>Then if the proof of $\phi(x)\vdash\phi(Sx)$ has the ordinal $\omega^\alpha$, the proof with the conclusion $\phi(0)\vdash\phi(y)$ is assigned the ordinal $\omega^{\alpha+1}$.  E.g. if the proof of the induction step had ordinal $\omega^0 = 1$, then the conclusion $\phi(y)$ has the ordinal $\omega^1 = \omega$.</p>

<p>This part makes perfect sense to me, because if I wanted to eliminate the use of an induction rule (CJ sequent) I might just start with $\phi(0)$ and repeatedly go through the part of the proof that I used to prove $\phi(x)\vdash\phi(Sx)$.  Say, I'd repeat the sub-proof of the induction step 17 times, e.g. with $\phi(14)\vdash\phi(15)$ and so on, until I got to $\phi(17)$, or whichever number I wanted to prove $\phi$ about.</p>

<p>I don't quite understand how this corresponds to eliminating <i>cuts</i>, per se (it seems to create a host of new cuts, in fact).  But it is still very <i>intuitive</i> to me that Peano Arithmetic's power to invoke the induction axiom would correspond to multiplication by $\omega$.  If we take a proof in PA that ends with a single use of the induction axiom to get $\phi(y)$, and we want to translate it into a proof in an arithmetic theory that doesn't have induction, then we might have to multiply the PA-proof-length by any finite number (e.g. multiply it by 17) to get the proof length in the inductionless theory.</p>

<p>Repeated multiplication by $\omega$ only takes us up to $\omega^\omega$ as a proof-theoretic ordinal, though.</p>

<p>According to Gentzen, when we use cuts on formulas involving quantifiers, e.g. $\forall p:\exists q:\psi(p,q)$, this corresponds to ordinal exponentiation.  If the proof above the cut has ordinal $\alpha$ and we cut a formula with one quantifier, then the proof below the cut has ordinal $\omega^\alpha$.  If we cut on two quantifiers, the proof below the cut has ordinal $\omega^{\omega^\alpha}$.  This fits with other things I've heard about how PA using formulas with only N quantifiers can be proven consistent by PA using only N+1 quantifiers.  (As a side issue I'd be interested in knowing how you use N quantifiers to prove wellfoundedness of an ordinal notation for a stack of $\omega$s N layers high.)</p>

<p>What I don't understand is why the ability to use quantifiers corresponds to ordinal exponentiation.  I can guess in a vague sense that if we have a proof using $\forall p:\phi(p)\vdash\phi(17)$, and we want to eliminate the use of $\forall p:\phi(p)$, then we need to repeat that part of the proof each time we want to prove $\phi(17)$, $\phi(q)$, and so on.  But this would again just imply that we needed to repeat that part of a proof a finite number of times, and iterating this takes us up to only $\omega^\omega$, not the desired $\epsilon_0$, so I must be missing something.</p>

<p>I asked a friend to help with this and she's read through Gentzen's relevant papers, and she's shown me the relevant parts, and I'd previously checked several standard texts on proof theory and Googled around, and she's also shopped the question around the logic department of a major university, and we still don't know any answer to this except ""because Gentzen says to use ordinal exponentiation"".</p>

<p>We also can't find any examples of cut-elimination being carried out on a proof with cut on a quantified formula, which shows how the size of the resulting cut-free proof could grow faster than $f_{\omega^\omega}$.  An example like this for some particular proof would be <i>very</i> helpful, even if, of necessity, the repeated steps for eliminating the cut are sketched more than shown.  I can understand why the length of a Kirby-Paris hydra game grows at the same rate as the Goodstein sequence, and visualize both processes insofar as a human being possibly can.  I cannot visualize why the length of a PA-proof heading for cut-freeness would grow at that same rate as cuts were repeatedly eliminated.  (Mapping the process onto a Kirby-Paris hydra game of starting height at least 3 would answer the question!)</p>

<p>The definition for classical logic is as follows:
$T$ has SOP$_n$ (for $n\geq 3$) if there is a formula $\varphi(x,y)$ (where $x$ and $y$ are tuples of the same length) and a sequence $(a_i)_{i&lt;\omega}$ (in some large model of $T$) such that</p>

</ol>

<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>The most direct guess for continuous logic would be to just replace ""$\varphi(x,y)$ holds"" with ""$\varphi(x,y)=0$"".</p>

<p>$T$ has SOP$_n$ (for $n\geq 3$) if there is a formula $\varphi(x,y)$ (where $x$ and $y$ are tuples of the same length) and a sequence $(a_i)_{i&lt;\omega}$ (in some large model of $T$) such that</p>

<ol>

<p><br/></p>

<p>I am concerned that is translation is too direct and not ""approximate"" enough. Although it does admit the same characterization as in classical logic of being able to make directed cycles out of the 2-type of an indiscernible sequence:</p>

<p>The following are equivalent.</p>

<ol>
<li>$T$ has SOP$_n$.</li>
<li>There is an indiscernible sequence $(a_i)_{i&lt;\omega}$ such that if $p(x,y)=\textrm{tp}(a_0,a_1)$ then
$$
p(x_1,x_2)\cup\ldots\cup p(x_{n-1},x_n)\cup p(x_n,x_1)
$$
is unsatisfiable.</li>
</ol>

<p>This statement works equally well in the classical or continuous setting (with the definitions above).</p>

<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>If this continuous definition for SOP$_n$ is acceptable, then it seems like the most reasonable way to define the strong order property is just to say:</p>

<p>$T$ has the <b>strong order property</b> if there is a formula $\varphi(x,y)$ (where $x$ and $y$ are tuples of the same length) and a sequence $(a_i)_{i&lt;\omega}$ (in some large model of $T$) such that</p>

"<p>My function is $f:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N},\ f(n)=2\uparrow ^n 3$ , the Ackermann(-Péter) function, with the second argument fixed to 3 (and ""$\uparrow$"" the Knuth up-arrow), which I believe is not primitive recursive, but which I could not prove - and that is what this question is about. Any ideas for the proof are very welcome.</p>

<p>Explanation: </p>

<p><strong>Idea 1</strong>
I have tried to prove that it is not primitive recursive in the lines of the proof that the Ackermann function is not primitive recursive - meaning I tried to prove, that my function $f$ bounds in some way all the other primitive recursive functions, so that I arrive at a contradiction, if I assume, that $f$ would be primitive recursive, because than it would bound itself.
The way in which I tried to prove, that $f$ should bound all the other functions was: If $g$ is an arbitrary primitive recursive $k$-ary function $g:\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, than there exists an natural number $N$, such that for all $n_1 , ..., n_k &gt; N$ we get $  g(n_1, ... ,n_k) &lt; f(n_1 + ... +n_k)$.</p>

<p>I thought I could try to prove this by trying to prove, that the set of all primitive recursive functions, which are bounded by f like described above, fulfills the properties which the primitive functions have to fulfill (the ""standart"" functions belong to this set, the set is closed under composition, the set is closed under primitive recursion). Since the primitive recursive functions are the smallest set, that fulfills these properties, I would obtain that this set has to equal the set of all the primitive recursive functions, which would the give me my contradiction.
But this proof failed as well, because I can't show, that this set is closed under composition - that is, I can't show that given functions $h:\mathbb{N}^l \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and $g:\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, which have the property, that:</p>

<p>$\exists N_1 \ \forall n_1,\ldots,n_{l}&gt;N_1$ such that $h(n_1 ,\ldots ,n_{l})&lt;2 \uparrow^{n_1 + \ldots + n_{l}} 3$ </p>

<p>and </p>

<p>$\forall i \in $ {$ 1,\ldots,l $}$ \ \exists N_{i+1} \ \forall n_1,\ldots, n_{k} &gt; N_{i+1} $ such that $g_i(n_1, \ldots ,n_{k})&lt;2 \uparrow^{n_1 + \ldots + n_{k}} 3$ </p>

<p>then there should exists an $N$ such that $\forall n_1,\ldots,n_{k}&gt;N$ we should also have, that $t(n_1,\ldots,n_k):=f(g_1(n_1,\ldots ,n_k),\ldots ,g_l(n_1,\ldots,n_k))&lt;2 \uparrow^{n_1 + \ldots + n_{k}} 3$.</p>

<p>In trying to prove the this, I somehow have to make use of the above properties of the functions $g_i$ and $h$. But I can't use the ""boundedness"" of $h$ because I can't control how much the functions $g_i$ grow - if there aren't values $n_1,\ldots ,n_k$ such that each of the $g_i$'s grow above $N_1$, then I can't make use of $h$'s properties.
Maybe there is some other way to prove the closedness under composition, but I can't see it. </p>

<p><strong>Idea 2</strong></p>

<p>I have tried, to proceed indirectly and to assume, that my $f$ would be primitive recursive - the idea was to construct out of this now primitive recursive $f$ another primitive recursive function, that would violate the ""Ackermann""-bound - in the sense of the original proof, where one proves that the Ackermann function is not primitive recursive, by first establishing this ""Ackermann"" bound which all primitive recursive functions have to obey and then showing, that if the Ackermann function is assumend to be primitive recursive one obatains a contradiction.</p>

<p>Could anyone please give me an idea how to finish one of this proof ?</p>

<p>Although this topology is definitely less nice than the standard one - for example, it is non-metrizable - it satisfies the <em>strong Choquet property</em>: this is the statement that player I has a winning strategy in a certain topological game. From the strong Choquet property we can deduce many results whose proof would follow easily from metrizability, so in some sense the Gandy-Harrington topology is ""close enough"" to metrizable.

Unfortunately, for $k&gt;1$ the strong Choquet property fails badly in $\tau_k$!</p>

<p><b>Question.</b> Which finitely presented groups can be
distinguished by decidable properties?</p>

<p>To be precise, let us say that &phi; is a <em>decidable</em> property of finitely
presented groups, if there is a class A of finitely
presented groups, closed under group isomorphisms, such that
{ p | &lang;p&rang; &isin; A } is decidable, where &lang;p&rang; denotes the group presented by p. That is, we insist that the decision procedure give the same answer for presentations leading to the same group up to isomorphism.</p>

<p>One extreme case, perhaps unlikely, would be that any two non-isomorphic
finitely presented groups can be distinguished by decidable
properties, so that for any two finitely presented
non-isomorphic groups &lang;p&rang; and &lang;q&rang;,
there is a decidable property &phi; where &phi;(p) holds
and &phi;(q) fails. That would be quite remarkable. </p>

<p>If this is not the case, then there would be two finite group
presentations p and q, such that the groups presented
&lang;p&rang; and &lang;q&rang; are not isomorphic, but
they have all the same decidable properties. This also
would be remarkable. </p>

<p>Which is the case?</p>

<p>Another way to describe the question is in terms of the
equivalence relation &equiv;, which I introduced in <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/16532"">my
previous question</a>, where p
&equiv; q if &phi;(p) and &phi;(q) have the same answer for
any decidable property &phi; of finitely presented groups. This
is precisely the equivalence relation of ""having all the
same decidable properties"". Of course, this includes the
group-isomorphism relation, and the current question is
asking: What is this relation &equiv;? In particular, is
&equiv; the same as the group isomorphism relation?
If it is, then any two non-isomorphic finitely presented
groups can be distinguished by decidable properties; if
not, then there are two finitely presented non-isomorphic
groups &lang;p&rang;, &lang;q&rang; having all the same
decidable properties.</p>

<p>Henry Wilton has emphasized several times that there are
relatively few truly interesting decidable properties of
finitely presented groups. This may very well be true.
Nevertheless, the answers to the previous MO questions on
this topic have provided at least <em>some</em> decidable
properties, and my question here is asking the extent to
which these properties are able to distinguish any two
finitely presented groups.</p>

<p>In particular, in these previous MO questions, <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/15957"">Chad Groft</a>
inquired whether there were
any nontrivial decidable properties of finitely presented
groups. <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/15957#16122"">John Stillwell's 
answer</a> was
that one could decide many questions about the
abelianization of the group. In a <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/16532"">subsequent question</a>, I
inquired whether all decidable properties were really about
the abelianization, and <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/15957#16122"">David Speyer's
answer</a> was
that no, there were questions about other quotients, such
as whether the group had a nontrivial homomorphism into a
particular finite group, such as A<sub>5</sub>. In a <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/16565"">third question</a>, David generalized further and inquired
whether all decidable properties depended on the
profinitization, and the answer again was no (provided by David and Henry). So at least
in these cases we have been increasingly able to separate
groups by decidable properties.</p>

<p>A generalization of the question would move beyond the
decidable properties. For example, if we consider the
computably enumerable (c.e.) properties, then we have quite
a lot more ability to distinguish groups. A property is
c.e. if there is a computable algorithm to determine the
positive instances of &phi;(p), but without requiring the
negative instances to ever converge on an answer. For
example, the word problem for any finitely presented group,
or indeed, for any computably presented group, is
computably enumerable, since if a word is indeed trivial, we will eventually discover this. Using the same idea as David's answer to my question, it follows that the question of
whether a finitely presented group &lang;p&rang; admits a
nontrivial homomorphism into the integers Z, say,  or many other
groups, is computably enumerable. One may simply try out all possible maps of the generators. A generalization of
this establishes:</p>

<p><b>Theorem.</b> The question of whether one finitely
presented group &lang;p&rang; maps homomorphically onto (or into) another &lang;q&rang; is computably enumerable.</p>

<p>The proof is that given p and q, one can look for a map of
the generators of p to the words of q, such that all
relations of p are obeyed by the image in q, and such that
all the generators of q are in the range of the resulting
map. This is a c.e.
property, since one can look for all possible candidates
for the map of the generators of p into words of q, and
check whether the relations are obeyed and the generators
of q are in the range of the map and so on. If they are,
eventually this will be observed, and at the point one can
be confident that &lang;p&rang; maps onto &lang;q&rang;. More generally, is the isomorphism relation itself c.e.? It is surely computable from the halting problem 0', since we could ask 0' whether the kernel of the proposed map was trivial or not, and it would know the answer. </p>

<ul>
<li>Where does the isomorphism relation on finitely
presented groups fit into the hierarchy of Turing
degrees? Is it c.e.? Is it Turing equivalent to the Halting problem?</li>
</ul>

<p>Once one moves to the c.e. properties, it is similarly
natural to move beyond the finitely presented groups to the
computably presented groups (those having a computable
presentation, not necessarily finitely generated). In this
context, the proof above no longer works, and the natural
generalization of the question asks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which computably presented groups are distinguished by
c.e. properties?</li>
</ul>

<p>The isomorphism relation on finitely generated computably
presented groups (given the presentations) seems to be
computable from the halting problem for the same reason as
in the proof above, but now one doesn't know at a finite
stage that the proposed map of the generators will
definitely work, since one must still check all the
relations-yet-to-be-enumerated. But 0' knows the answer, so
we get it computably in 0'. In the infinitely generated case,
however, things are more complicated.</p>

I would appreciate a reasoned technical view from experts in the field.</p>

<p>Note 1. Since the response by user ""none"" cites Lou Kauffman's ""grossone"" article in category theory, I added the appropriate tag.</p>

<p>Note 2. ""none"" mentioned similarity to the <em>sur</em>reals but Sergeyev himself compares his theory to the <em>hyper</em>reals, hence the tag.</p>

<p>Note 3. In a comment accessible <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00283-015-9600-7"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> Sergeyev asserts that ""Levi-Civita numbers are built using a generic infinitesimal $\varepsilon$ ... whereas our numerical computations with finite quantities are concrete and not generic.""  Here apparently ""finite"" is a misprint and should be ""infinite"". How is this comment on the difference between Sergeyev's grossone one the one hand, and the Levi-Civita unit on the other, to be understood?</p>

<p>Note 4. In a 2013 article, Sergeyev compares his grossone to Levi-Civita in the following terms in footnote 5: <em>5 At the first glance the numerals (7) can remind numbers from the Levi-Civita field (see [20]) that is a very interesting and important precedent of algebraic manipulations with infinities and infinitesimals. However, the two mathematical objects have several crucial differences. They have been introduced for different purposes by using two mathematical languages having different accuracies and on the basis of different methodological foundations. In fact, Levi-Civita does not discuss the distinction between numbers and numerals. His numbers have neither cardinal nor ordinal properties; they are build using a generic infinitesimal and only its rational powers are allowed; he uses symbol 1 in his construction; there is no any numeral system that would allow one to assign numerical values to these numbers; it is not explained how it would be possible to pass from d a generic infinitesimal h to a concrete one (see also the discussion above on the distinction between numbers and numerals). In no way the said above should be considered as a criticism with respect to results of Levi-Civita. The above discussion has been introduced in this text just to underline that we are in front of two different mathematical tools that should be used in different mathematical contexts.</em> It would be interesting to have a specialist in numerical analysis comment on Sergeyev's use of the term ""numerical"" to explain the difference between his grossone and an infinite element of the Levi-Civita field.</p>

<p>Note 5. The latest installment of grossone numerals appeared in <em>The Mathematical Intelligencer</em> <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00283-014-9511-z"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> (<em>Olympic Medals</em>). I would be interested in an evaluation by the experts.</p>

<p>Note 6. At a different venue (see comment by Daniel Moskovich), Charles Stewart pointed out that ""As it happens, the Grossone numbers considered as polynomials seem to be a generalisation of these REXes [rational exponential expressions], allowing subtraction in addition to the operations I described above. If that's right, then Sergeyev claims to have such a decision procedure."" The question is whether Sergeyeyev has such a decision procedure.</p>

<p>Note 7. My understanding of Gabriele Lolli's <em>answer</em> is that he sees Sergeyev as developing a <em>conservative</em> extension of the intended model of PA, allegedly contrary to previous models; and of Daniel Moskovich's <em>answer</em>, that Sergeyev is adopting standards of rigor of an <em>applied</em> mathematician and therefore should not be judged by the standards of rigor of <em>pure</em> mathematicians.

<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=de&amp;q=%22conditions+of+possibility%22"" rel=""nofollow"">Condition of possibility</a> is an important philosophical concept. Naively, this concept could be formally defined this way: </p>

In the other words, is there any other known non-trivial result in the form ""$ZFC+PFA\vdash 2^{\aleph_{\alpha}}=\aleph_{\beta}$"" for some ordinals $\alpha , \beta$, or all other situations are consistent with $PFA$ like Easton's theorem in presence of some large cardinal?</p>

One can consider existence of another large cardinal tree in the <strong>shadow</strong> of the current standard tree of large cardinal assumptions including $PFA$ in a rank near supercompacts. (The equiconsistency of PFA and supercompacts is not proved yet but we assume it for straightforwardness of the below diagram.)</p>

<p>Maybe Godel's conjecture and program are true if we replace the standard tree of large cardinals with another tree with equiconsistent steps. Please note the following imaginary <strong>large cardinal ladder</strong> which includes <strong>two parallel trees</strong> of ""large cardinal"" assumptions: </p>

<p><strong>Q2.</strong> Can we complete the middle part of the following ladder by some axioms like $A$, $B$, $C$, ..., $X$ which are equiconsistent with usual large cardinal axioms and also refute $CH$, $GCH$ and $V=L$ in direction of Godel's program? </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/MuIcq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Update.</strong> Using above approach to large cardinal axioms (inspired by success of $PFA$ in deciding $CH$ and its possible equiconsistency with existence of supercompact cardinals) we can restate Godel's program in deciding independent statements of set theory as follows:</p>

<p><strong>For every independent statement $\sigma$ from $ZFC$ there is a (standard) large cardinal axiom $I$ and a statement $J$ (a non-standard large cardinal axiom) such that:</strong></p>

<p><strong>(a) Consistency of $ZFC+I$ implies consistency of $ZFC+J$.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(b) $ZFC+J$ decides $\sigma$ (i.e. $ZFC+J\vdash \sigma$ or $ZFC+J\vdash \neg\sigma$)</strong></p>

<p>In the other words one can decide any independent statement of mathematics using some standard/non-standard large cardinal axiom.</p>

$$V_0(M) = M, \quad V_{\alpha+1}(M) = V_\alpha\cup P(V_\alpha(M)), \quad V_\lambda = \bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\lambda}V_\alpha(M)$$
when $\lambda$ is a limit ordinal. Let
$$V(M) = \bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\infty}V_\alpha(M).$$
Then $G$ has a natural action on $V(M)$ defined inductively by
$$g(x) = \{g(y):y\in x\}.$$
If $x\in V(M)$ and $S\subseteq M$, then $S$ supports $x$ if $G(S)\subseteq G(\{x\})$, where $G(S)$ is the pointwise stabilizer of $S$ and $G(\{x\})$ is the setwise stabilizer of $x$. The imaginaries are those $x\in V(M)$ which have finite support.</p>

"<p>It is well known that primitive recursion is not powerful enough
to express all functions, Ackermann function being probably the best

<p>Now, in the logic courses (that I have had look at) one always proceeded from primitive recursion to mu-recursion.

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose I have a first-order theory $T$. Under what conditions are there ""few"" models of $T$ across all possible forcing extensions of the universe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe ""few"" is the wrong word - what I really mean is, when does the collection of ""models of $T$ you can get by forcing"" have some nontrivial structure?</p>

<p>There are a bunch of aspects of this question; the one I'm interested in right now is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Say that a theory $T$ is <em>generically embeddable</em> if - whenever $\mathbb{P}$ is a forcing notion and $\nu$ is a $\mathbb{P}$-name such that $\Vdash_\mathbb{P}``\nu\models T""$ - there is some forcing notion $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$-name $\mu$ such that $$\Vdash_{\mathbb{P}\times\mathbb{Q}} ``\mbox{$(\mu[G_1]\models T)$ and there is a homomorphism $h\colon \nu[G_0]\rightarrow\mu[G_1]$}.""$$ (Note that this homomorphism of course exists in $V[G_0\times G_1]$.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To get a sense of what this means, let's look at a counterexample. Take $T$ to be the true theory of second-order arithmetic - that is, $T=Th(\omega\sqcup 2^\omega; +, \times, \in)$. Then models of $T$ code reals, and this is bad. Specifically, let $\mathbb{P}$ be Cohen forcing, and let $\nu$ be the $\mathbb{P}$-name picking out the ""true"" model $(\omega\sqcup 2^\omega; +, \times, \in)^{V[G]}$. Then if $G_0\times G_1$ is $\mathbb{P}\times\mathbb{Q}$ generic - for any $\mathbb{Q}$! - since the real $G_0$ won't be in $V[G_1]$, no model $N$ of $T$ in $V[G_1]$ will embed $\nu[G_0]$, since such a homomorphism would have to biject $\nu[G_0]$ with the well-founded segment of $N$, and from this we could recover $G_0$ in $V[G_1]$.</p>

<p>More generally, <em>theories which let you code sets are bad.</em></p>

<p>My question is: <strong>When is a theory generically embeddable?</strong> Specifically, are there model-theoretic niceness properties which guarantee this? For instance, I can't come up with a <em>stable</em> example of a non-generically embeddable theory $T$, but I also can't prove there isn't one. I can prove that if $T$ is totally categorical, then $T$ is generically embeddable, but this isn't very interesting (in fact, it's hard not to prove this).</p>

<p>EDIT: Note that there are many natural strengthenings of this: e.g.</p>

<ul>

<p>However suppose that I were to refine my question. Suppose that $ZFC\subseteq{T}$ is complete and consistent. Is $T$ existentially closed? If I were to guess, I would guess no. However I'm having trouble proving this.</p>

<p>I would guess the same for a complete theory $Th({\mathbb{N}},+, \times, &lt;,0,1) \subseteq{T'}$, and I would like to have an argument that is applicable in both cases.</p>

<p>My original idea for both was to exploit the fact that for an infinite linear order where each element has a unique predecessor and a unique successor, I can show that a structure is not existentially closed by adding an element in between two elements to obtain an extension.
However this idea fails for $Th({\mathbb{N}},+, \times, &lt;,0,1)$ in the following sense: </p>

<p>Given $M\models{T'}$ and $a,b\in{M}$ such that $b=a+1$, I can't use compactness to add a new $c$ s.t. $a&lt;c&lt;b$ while also extending $T'\cup{\text{Diag}(M)}$ for the following reason; as $b=a+1$ will be in the diagram of $M$ that I'm trying to extend and $a&lt;c&lt;b$ would imply $b\neq{a+1}$ in the extension. So the option seems to be to construct models witnessing the failure of the criterion from scratch.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about $ZFC\subseteq{T}$. There will be a lot of linear orders (without any additional structure as in the above example) in a model of $T$ to play around with, but extending a model of set theory is not an easy task! </p>

"<p>This is basically a reference request, but the post is going to be relatively long (and a little bit verbose): I apologize in advance for that.</p>

<p><strong>Premise.</strong> There are several examples of ""ordered structures""  appearing in nature (at least for the moment, let me be vague with the actual meaning of various terms I'm using): <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_group"" rel=""nofollow"">ordered groups</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_ring"" rel=""nofollow"">ordered rings</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_vector_space"" rel=""nofollow"">ordered vector spaces</a>, etc. All of these have something in common: They are algebraic structures, where each operation is compatible, in some sense and in some way, with a (partial) order. Thus, I find it reasonable to ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What about a fully formal definition of an ordered structure, in general?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For simplicity, I'm <em>not</em> seeking a definition worded in the language of categories, and I'm looking at the case where ""structure"" means whatever can be understood as a (classical) model of a finitary, single-sorted, first-order <em>algebraic</em> theory in the frame of model theory (in principle, I'm also interested in possibly non-finitary or many-sorted structures, but the general case would probably make things look more complicated than they are and overshadow some relevant details).</p>

<p>The most basic, non-trivial example is provided by structures with <em>one</em> operation. For instance, an <em>ordered semigroup</em> is a triple $\mathbb A = (A, {\cdot}\,, \preceq)$, where $(A, \cdot)$ is a semigroup (written multiplicatively) and $\preceq$ an order on $A$ with the property that $xz \preceq yz$ and $zx \preceq zy$ for all $x,y,z \in A$ such that $x \preceq y$.</p>

<p>Of course, the axiom of associativity doesn't play any role in these definitions, so from a fundamental point of view it would have been morally better to replace ""semigroups"" with ""magmas"" in the previous paragraph, but on the other hand, that doesn't really matter, insofar as I'm just using ordered semigroups as a guiding example to forge a tentative answer to my question along the following lines.</p>

<p><strong>Naive (and ""wrong"") approach.</strong> Let $T$ be a finitary, single-sorted, first-order theory, which, to me, means a triple $(\sigma, \Xi, V)$, where:</p>

<ol>
<li>$V$ is an infinite countable set of (logical) variables from the formal language, $\mathcal L$, underlying the axiomatic theory used to lay out the foundations (say, Tarski-Grothendieck set theory, as oversized as it may appear);</li>
<li>$\sigma$ is a (single-sorted) signature, namely a triple $(\Sigma_{\rm f}, \Sigma_{\rm r}, \varrho)$ consisting of a set of function symbols $\Sigma_{\rm f}$, a set of relation symbols $\Sigma_{\rm r}$, and a function $\varrho: \Sigma_{\rm f} \cup \Sigma_{\rm r} \to \mathbf N^+$ such that $\Sigma_{\rm f}$, $\Sigma_{\rm r}$, and the set of (logical and non-logical) symbols of $\mathcal L$ are pairwise disjoints (the function $\varrho$ assigns to each function or relation symbol of $\sigma$ an ariety; in particular, an $n$-ary function symbol will correspond, in any model of the theory, to a function $A^{n-1} \to A$ (for some set $A$), and an $n$-ary relation symbol to a subset of $A^n$);</li>
<li>$\Xi$ is a (possibly empty) subset of $\langle V; \sigma \rangle$,  the set of all (well-formed) formulas generated by combining, according to the formation rules of first-order logic, the variables in $V$, the (function and relation) symbols of $\sigma$, and those of $\mathcal L$ which are not logical variables.</li>
</ol>

<p>(The role of $V$ is meaningless here, as we could assume that $V$ includes <em>all</em> the variables in $\mathcal L$; however, it starts being meaningful in the case of many-sorted theories, and that's why I beg your indulgence for being redundant in this respect.)</p>

<p>Now, $T$ is called an algebraic theory if $\Sigma_{\rm r}$ is empty (in which case $\sigma$ is referred to as an algebraic signature), and since we are interested in structures that are algebraic except for the fact of being endowed with an order, we may refer to $T$ as a quasi-algebraic theory if</p>

<ol>
<li>$\Sigma_{\rm r}$ consists of <em>one</em> relation symbol $R$, subjected to the axioms of reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity (for binary relations), which are hence comprised among the formulas in $\Xi$ (so that $R$ is interpreted as a partial order in any possible model of $T$);</li>
<li>$\Xi$ includes basic formulas encoding the compatibility between each function symbol of $\sigma$ and the relation $R$, which can be phrased as follows: If $\varsigma$ is a function symbol in $\Sigma_{\rm f}$ of ariety $n := \varrho(\varsigma)$, then the formula
$$
\forall \vec{x}, \vec{y} \in V^{n-1}: R^{(2n-2)}(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \implies R(\varsigma(\vec{x}), \varsigma(\vec{y}))\qquad\qquad(\star)
$$
belongs to $\Xi$. (The notation should be self-explanatory, but let me note that the formula in the case of constant symbols is redundant, in the sense that it is implied, in any model of theory, by the very fact that $R$ is reflexive; yet, having it there makes the approach look more ""uniform"" than otherwise, in the same spirit of Joel David Hamkins' comment below.)</li>
</ol>

<p>An ordered structure would then be any model of a quasi-algebraic theory.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the above doesn't work even in the case of (the theory of) groups, where $\Sigma_{\rm f}$ consists, say, of the symbols $\cdot$ (binary symbol for ""multiplication""), ${}^{-1}$ (unary symbol for ""inversion""), and $1$ (constant symbol for ""identity""). In fact, the naive approach would suggest to assume one binary relation symbol, say $\preceq$, in $\Sigma_{\rm r}$ and the following axioms in $\Xi$:
$$
\begin{split}
(1)\ &amp; \forall x, y, z \in V: x \cdot (y \cdot z) = (x \cdot y) \cdot z \\
(2)\ &amp; \forall x \in V: x \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot x = x \\
(3)\ &amp; \forall x,y \in V: x \cdot x^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot x = 1 \\
(4)\ &amp; \forall x,y,z \in V: (x \preceq x) \land (((x \preceq y) \land (y \preceq y) \implies (x=y))) \land (((x \preceq y) \land (y \preceq z) \implies (x \preceq z))) \\
(5)\ &amp; \forall x,y \in V: (x \preceq y) \implies (x^{-1} \preceq y^{-1}) \\
(6)\ &amp; \forall x,y,z \in V: (x \preceq y) \implies ((x \cdot z \preceq y \cdot z) \land (z \cdot x \preceq z \cdot y)) \\
\end{split}
$$
The problem is that the 5th axiom is essentially incompatible with the 6th, as the latter yields that, in every model $(A; +, \cdot\,,1;\preceq)$ of $T$, we have $x \preceq y$ iff $y^{-1} \preceq x^{-1}$.</p>

<p><strong>Remedies.</strong> One may argue that the ""mistake"" lies in the fact of including the function symbol ${}^{-1}$ in the signature of the theory, while an alternative could be to avoid it and replace the 3th axiom above with:</p>

<p>$$
\forall x \in V, \exists\, \tilde{x} \in V: x \cdot \tilde{x} = \tilde{x} \cdot x = 1.
$$
This is certainly a possibility (as long as $\mathcal L$ includes both $\forall$ and $\exists$ among the logical symbols), but I find it rather ""artificial"" (whatever it may mean), all the more that the same strategy fails if we try to use the naive approach outlined in the above to recover as a special case the common definition of an ordered ring, for which the compatibility between multiplication and order is ""restricted to nonnegative factors"", which has no hope to fit in the paradigm implied by condition $(\star)$.</p>

<p>So, putting it all together, my (second) question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where should I look up for a sufficiently general definition of ""ordered structure"", which copes with the kind of issues that I've tried to point out in this post?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've my own ideas on what to do, but there may be a much better way on how to proceed, which is what I'm looking for. In particular, one solution could be as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a finitary, single-sorted, first-order theory $T = (\sigma, \Xi, V)$, whose signature is of the form $((\varsigma_i)_{i \in I}, (R_i)_{i \in I \,\cup\, \{\infty\}}, \varrho)$ for some index set $I$ and $\infty \notin I$, so that each function symbol $\varsigma$ has one corresponding relation symbol of ariety $2\varrho(\varsigma)-2$, and we have an extra relation symbol $R_\infty$.</li>
<li>Make $\Xi$ include, for each relation symbol $R$ of $\sigma$, the axioms of reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity (extended, as appropriate, from binary to $2n$-ary relations), so that, in particular, $R_\infty$ is interpreted as an
order in any possible model of the theory.</li>
<li>Rewrite condition ($\star$) so as to replace, for each
function symbol $\varsigma$ of $\sigma$, the symbol ""$R^{(2n-2)}$"" to the left of the connective ""$\implies$"" with the (unique) relation
corresponding to the function symbol $\varsigma$, and the symbol ""$R$"" to the right with ""$R_\infty$"".</li>
</ol>

<p>These conditions together describe a paradigm I will refer to as (P), the last condition encoding the naive idea that the relations $R_i$ must be glued together in a ""consistent way"" (and can't be ""completely independent"" from each other, which otherwise would result into something exceedingly general, I feel).</p>

<p><strong>An example.</strong> Assume the (algebraic) theory of unital rings is encoded by the (algebraic) signature whose set of function symbols is given by $\Sigma_{\rm ring} := \{+, \cdot\,, -\,, 0, 1\}$, where $+$ and $\cdot$ are, respectively, the binary symbols for ""addition"" and ""multiplication"", $-$ is the unary symbol for ""additive inverse"", and $0$ and $1$ are, respectively, the constant symbols for ""additive identity"" and ""multiplicative identity"". The axioms of the theory are the usual ones:
$$
\begin{split}
(1)\ &amp; \forall x, y, z \in V: (x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z) \land (x \cdot (y \cdot z) = (x \cdot y) \cdot z) \\
(2)\ &amp; \forall x \in V: (x+0 = 0 + x = x) \land (x \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot x = x) \\
(3)\ &amp; \forall x,y \in V: x + (-x) = (-x) + x = 0 \\
(4)\ &amp; \forall x,y,z \in V: (x \cdot (y+z) = (x \cdot y) + (x \cdot z)) \land ((y+z) \cdot x = (y \cdot x) + (z \cdot x)) \\
\end{split}
$$
Now, according to the paradigm (P), the theory of ordered rings would have a signature of the form $(\Sigma_{\rm ring}, \Sigma_{\rm r}, \varrho)$, where $\Sigma_{\rm r}$ is a set of relation symbols of the form $\{R_{(+)}, R_{(\cdot)}, R_{(-)}, R_{(0)}, R_{(1)}, \preceq\}$, with each relation symbol subjected to the axioms of reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity, all the relation symbols glued together by the 4th condition of (P), and each function symbol $\varsigma$ in $\Sigma_{\rm ring}$ ""bound"" to the corresponding relation symbol $R_{(\varsigma)} \in \Sigma_{\rm r}$ by the formula:
$$
\forall (\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \in V^{n-1} \times V^{n-1}: R_{(\varsigma)}(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \implies (\varsigma(\vec{x}) \preceq \varsigma(\vec{y})),
$$
where $n$ is the ariety of $\varsigma$.</p>

<p>In particular, this paradigm fits with the usual notion of an ordered ring, which is then a tuple $\mathbb A = (A; +, \cdot\,,-\,,0,1; R_{(+)}, R_{(\cdot)}, R_{(-)}, \preceq)$, where $\preceq$ is a partial order on $A$, $R_{(+)}$ the subset of $A^2 \times A^2$ consisting of those pairs $((x,y),(x,z))$ or $((y,x),(z,x))$ with $y \preceq z$, $R_{(\cdot)}$ the subset of $A^2 \times A^2$ consisting of those pairs $((x,y),(x,z))$ or $((y,x),(z,x))$ such that $0 \preceq x$ and $y \preceq z$, and $R_{(-)} = \{(x,x): x \in A\}$. (I'm intentionally omitting any explicit reference in models to the relations associated with constants, for they don't add any information, as a result of considerations already made in the above.)</p>

"<p>It seems to me that for most of the twentieth century, axiomatic foundations for mathematical theories were constructed with the (mostly allied) goals of minimizing the number of primitive notions and minimizing the number of axioms.  But one could equally well be guided by the goal of minimizing the logical depth of the axioms, i.e., minimizing the use of quantifiers.</p>

<p>Consider group theory, for instance.  I have seen formalizations of group theory that say ""There exists an element $h \in G$ such that for all $g \in G$, $gh=hg=g$"" and then go on to prove that $h$ is unique and to name it $e$.  But I have also seen formalizations that say ""A group is a set $G$ equipped with an element $e$ such that..."" which eliminates the need for a quantifier in an axiom.  Likewise, if one includes the operation $g \mapsto g^{-1}$ as a primitive, one can avoid the axiom ""For all $g$ there exists $h$ such that $gh=hg=e$"" (or worse, ""For all $g$ there exists $h$ such that for all $h'$, $ ghh'=hgh'=h'gh=h'hg""$, which I haven't seen, but which I can imagine a certain sorts of purist preferring!).</p>

<p>I know that in constructive mathematics, the status of existential quantifiers is suspect to begin with, so I imagine that there's already quite a bit of writing in foundations and philosophy of mathematics (and maybe computable mathematics as well) that addresses this issue.  Some pointers to relevant literature would be appreciated.</p>

"<p>(I'm taking my definition of a cardinal characteristic from Blass' excellent article <a href=""http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~ablass/need.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~ablass/need.pdf</a>, which cites Vojtas/Fremlin/Miller; theirs is more general, but I'm already interested in this more restrictive context.) </p>

<p>Fix a binary relation $S$ on $\omega^\omega$. A set $X\subseteq \omega^\omega$ is <em>$S$-adequate</em> if for any $x\in \omega^\omega$ there is a $y\in X$ such that $xSy$. Assuming the reals are well-ordered, the cardinal characteristic associated to $S$ is then the minimum cardinality of any $S$-adequate set. For example, taking $S$ to be domination, $\le^*$, yields the dominating number $\mathfrak{d}$.</p>

<p>My question, roughly, is: to what extent is there a meaningful theory of cardinal characteristics in contexts where choice fails, perhaps very badly?</p>

<p>One approach that seems interesting to me is via ""theta-like"" cardinals. Recall that $\Theta$ is defined to be the smallest ordinal onto which $\mathbb{R}$ does not surject; see <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/47028/value-of-theta-in-zfad"">value of Theta in ZF+AD</a> for some facts about $\Theta$ in the context of $AD$, which is where it is usually studied. We can define analogues of $\Theta$ for cardinal characterstics, as follows: for $S$ a binary relation on $\omega^\omega$ (or similar) we define $\Theta_S$ as the supremum of the cardinals onto which every $S$-adequate set surjects. Assuming $\mathbb{R}$ is well-orderable this is of course equal to the standard cardinal associated with $S$; in the absence of such a fact, this is still a meaningful definition.</p>

<p>(Note that we could also define $\Theta_S$ as the supremum of the cardinalities which inject into every $S$-adequate set, but this seems less natural. For one thing, it is consistent that $\Theta_=\not=\Theta$, which is probably a bad sign.)</p>

  <p>(Q1) Is there work done on cardinal characteristics in the absence of choice, at all?</p>

<p>My instinct is that this is not really the right question - metarecursion theory doesn't live on $\omega$, it lives on $\omega_1^{CK}$, so the right thing to do is formulate a version of reverse math on $\omega_1^{CK}$ (in fact, Richard Shore <a href=""http://www.math.cornell.edu/~shore/papers/pdf/RMComp7.pdf"">http://www.math.cornell.edu/~shore/papers/pdf/RMComp7.pdf</a> has already done this for cardinals, and I don't see anything preventing his work extending to arbitrary admissible ordinals - although his theorems might not, of course, since they may require more admissiblity than $\Sigma_1$). But I'm still holding out hope that there's something neat that can happen already on $\omega$.</p>

parallel with catamorphisms and paramorphisms recursion schemas. I also omitted
the computation rules, as they are well known.</p>

<p>Now, this two ways to introduce the elimination rules let us build the same

has to recur on all the structure, while with $NatPara$ is always a single

"<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mathematics"">Reverse mathematics</a> (RM) is that area that tries to pin down exactly which axioms are necessary to prove theorems, given some weak base theory. Harvey Friedman has pointed out several times (on the <a href=""http://www.cs.nyu.edu/mailman/listinfo/fom"">FOM mailing list</a>) that $Con(PA)$ is equivalent to a variant of Bolzano-Weierstrass over the rationals between 0 and 1 inclusive (something like: every sequence has a subsequence $\{q_i\}$ which is Cauchy, in the that sense $\forall i,j \geq n, |q_i - q_j| &lt; 1/n$). Apparently a very similar result is given in <a href=""http://www.personal.psu.edu/t20/sosoa/"">Simpson's book</a> and ""it is clear to the experts"" how to get to Friedman's claim. (As an aside, I find this such an amazing result it should be written up for the average mathematician, and not buried in a vaguely equivalent form in a book that is hard to get one's hands on.)</p>

<p>The reason I bring up Bolzano-Weierstrass is that Todd Trimble, in a <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/a/210337"">nice answer</a> on <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/10535/ways-to-prove-the-fundamental-theorem-of-algebra"">Ways to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra</a>, uses B-W to prove (as the key tool among other, elementary considerations) the fundamental theorem of algebra.

<blockquote>
  <p>How close in reverse mathematical strength are the Bolzano-Weierstrass statement from Friedman's claim and the fundamental theorem of algebra?</p>

<p>If they are the same, then we find ourselves in the amazing situation that the consistency of PA is equivalent to a theorem that we all would use with no qualms whatsoever. However, I have a vague feeling that FTA is strictly weaker than BW (as used here), but cannot make this precise.</p>

"<p>The question's in the title and is easily stated, but let me try to give some details and explain why I'm interested.  First, a disclaimer: if the answer's not already somewhere in the literature then it could be rather hard; I'm asking this question here because MO is lucky enough to have some of the foremost experts on lacunary hyperbolic groups as active participants.</p>

<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>A group $\Gamma$ is <em>non-Hopfian</em> if there is an epimorphism $\Gamma\to\Gamma$ with non-trivial kernel.</p></li>
<li><p>A group $\Gamma$ is <em>lacunary hyperbolic</em> if some asymptotic cone of $\Gamma$ is an $\mathbb{R}$-tree.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To motivate this second definition, note that a group is word-hyperbolic if and only if <em>every</em> asymptotic cone is an $\mathbb{R}$-tree.</p>

<p>Lacunary hyperbolic groups were defined and investigated in a paper of <a href=""http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publdoc.html?arg3=&amp;co4=AND&amp;co5=AND&amp;co6=AND&amp;co7=AND&amp;dr=all&amp;pg4=AUCN&amp;pg5=AUCN&amp;pg6=PC&amp;pg7=ALLF&amp;pg8=ET&amp;r=1&amp;review_format=html&amp;s4=sapir&amp;s5=osin&amp;s6=&amp;s7=&amp;s8=All&amp;vfpref=html&amp;yearRangeFirst=&amp;yearRangeSecond=&amp;yrop=eq"">Ol'shanskii, Osin and Sapir</a> (although examples of lacunary hyperbolic groups that are not hyperbolic already existed---I believe the first one was constructed by Simon Thomas). They construct examples that exhibit very non-hyperbolic behaviour, including torsion groups and Tarski monsters.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Once again:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a non-Hopfian lacunary hyperbolic group?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>

<p>My motivation comes from logic, and the following fact.</p>

<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> A lacunary hyperbolic group is a direct limit of hyperbolic groups (satisfying a certain injectivity-radius condition).</p>

<p>That is to say, lacunary hyperbolic groups are limit groups over the class of all hyperbolic groups. (Note: the injectivity-radius condition means that there are other limit groups over hyperbolic groups which are not lacunary hyperbolic. I'm also interested in them.) Sela has shown that limit groups over a <em>fixed</em> hyperbolic group $\Gamma$ (and its subgroups) tell you a lot about the solutions to equations over $\Gamma$.  For instance, his result that a sequence of epimorphisms of $\Gamma$-limit groups eventually stabilises (which implies that all $\Gamma$-limit groups are Hopfian) has the following consequence.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem (Sela):</strong> Hyperbolic groups are equationally Noetherian.  That is, any infinite set of equations is equivalent to a finite subsystem.</p>

<p>In the wake of Sela's work we have a fairly detailed understanding of solutions to equations over a given word-hyperbolic group $\Gamma$.  But it's still a matter of great  interest to try to understand systems of equations over <em>all</em> hyperbolic groups.</p>

<p>Pathological behaviour in lacunary hyperbolic groups should translate into pathological results about systems of equations over hyperbolic groups.  A positive answer to my question would imply that the class of hyperbolic groups is not equationally Noetherian. And that would be quite interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.3978"">This paper</a> of Denis Osin already makes a connection between equations over a single lacunary hyperbolic group and equations over the class of all hyperbolic groups.</p>

<hr>

<p>This question attracted great answers from Yves Cornulier and Mark Sapir, as well as some excellent comments from Denis Osin.  Let me quickly clarify my goals in answering the question, and try to summarise what the state of knowledge seems to be.  I hope someone will correct me if I make any unwarranted conjectures!</p>

<p>My motivation came from the theory of equations over the class of all (word-)hyperbolic groups.  For these purposes, it is not important to actually find a non-Hopfian lacunary hyperbolic group; merely a non-Hopfian limit of hyperbolic groups is enough.  (That is, the injectivity radius condition in the above proposition can be ignored.)  Yves Cornulier gave an example of a limit of virtually free (in particular, hyperbolic) groups which is non-Hopfian.  From this one can conclude that the class of word-hyperbolic groups is not equationally Noetherian, as I had hoped.</p>

<p>[Note: I chose to accept Yves's answer.  Mark's answer is equally worthy of acceptance.]</p>

<p>Clearly, the pathologies of Yves's groups derive from torsion---the class of free groups is equationally Noetherian---and there are some reasons to expect torsion to cause problems, so I asked in a comment for torsion-free examples.  These were provided by Denis Osin, who referred to a <a href=""http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publdoc.html?arg3=&amp;co4=AND&amp;co5=AND&amp;co6=AND&amp;co7=AND&amp;dr=all&amp;pg4=AUCN&amp;pg5=AUCN&amp;pg6=TI&amp;pg7=ALLF&amp;pg8=ET&amp;review_format=html&amp;s4=ivanov&amp;s5=storozhev&amp;s6=&amp;s7=&amp;s8=All&amp;vfpref=html&amp;yearRangeFirst=&amp;yearRangeSecond=&amp;yrop=eq&amp;r=1&amp;mx-pid=2174100"">paper</a> of Ivanov and Storozhev.  Thus, we also have that the class of all torsion-free hyperbolic groups is not equationally Noetherian.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the question in the title---what if we require an actual lacunary hyperbolic group that is non-Hopfian.  First, it seems very likely that such a thing exists. As Mark says,  'A short answer is ""why not?""'.  More formally, Denis claims in a comment that the subspace of the space of marked groups consisting of lacunary hyperbolic groups is comeagre in the closure of the subspace of hyperbolic groups.  This formalises the idea that lacunary hyperbolic groups are not particularly special among limits of hyperbolic groups.</p>

<p>Mark also suggested two possible approaches to constructing a non-Hopfian lacunary hyperbolic group; however, in a comment, Denis questioned whether one of these approaches works.  In summary, I feel fairly confident in concluding that a construction of a non-Hopfian lacunary hyperbolic group is not currently known, although one should expect to be able to find one with a bit of work.</p>

  <p>Can we ever have $M$ be a generic extension of $N$ (either by set or class forcing in $M$)?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: As Douglas Ulrich points out below, the answer is no for set forcing, by an extension of the Kunen inconsistency. This barrier breaks down for class forcing, though (see Larson's book on stationary tower forcing), so the class version is still open.</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned above, I am almost certain the answer is ""no"", even if $M$ has loads of large cardinals, but I don't see how to prove this.</p>

<hr>

<p>A small observation:</p>

<p>Say (inside a model $W$) a cardinal $\mu$ is</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>potentially measurable</em> if $\mu$ is measurable in some forcing extension; and</p></li>
<li><p><em>reversibly measurable</em> if $\mu$ is measurable, and $W$ is a forcing extension of the transitive collapse of the ultrapower of $W$ by a measure on $\mu$ (that is, if $\mu$ is as above).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Then suppose we had such an $M, N, U, \kappa$, with $j$ the elementary embedding. Then $N$ satisfies ""There is a potential measurable below $j(\kappa)$,"" so - pulling back along $j$ - $M$ satisfies ""There is a potential measurable below $\kappa$."" This shows that - in $M$ - the least potentially measurable is strictly less than the least reversibly measurable (otherwise we get a descending chain of measurable cardinals).</p>

<p>Now, it feels plausible to me that there's a clever trick that can be done here to outright build a descending sequence of reversibly measurables from a single reversibly measurable; but I don't see it.</p>

that guarantee that we can view S as a Turing complete automaton?</p>

<p>I'll assume that C comes in the form of the topological product of finite sets. 
If necessary, I'll also assume also that C has a computable update rule.</p>

<p>Certainly strong assumptions on the conjugacy (including at least computability) would allow for the translation of problems about the fate of Game of Life configuration into questions about the fate of C configurations.  But I don't see what would make all such conjugacies computable or any appropriate way to carry out Conway's argument in purely dynamical terms.</p>

"<p>This is a largely a question of pedagogy/references, though I may have overlooked some nuance of actual mathematics. </p>

<p>I am planning to introduce the concept of Turing machines and the halting problem to utter novices. </p>

<p>The proofs (or rather proof sketches) of undecidability for the halting problem that I have seen fix a universal Turing machine and vary a program and an input that both reside on the TM's tape. In effect an infinite 0-1 array is formed which is indexed by programs and inputs, with entries indicating whether or not the TM supposedly halts on the corresponding program/input pair. One then employs a diagonal argument.</p>

<p>But it seems more concrete to me to ditch the stored program idiom, let the TM vary instead, and use a TM/input pair for the diagonal argument. It is very easy to produce an explicit enumeration of (binary) TMs, and far less so to detail an encoding scheme for a universal TM's tape that allows one to sensibly distinguish the program from the input (of course I know this <em>can</em> be done, but an existence proof is not a great primary approach for very inexperienced students, I think). </p>

<p>So, are there any references that discuss a proof of the undecidability of the halting problem along these lines? (A little part of me actually wonders whether or not I have missed some trivia that obstruct such a proof, because I haven't seen one.)</p>

"<p>I have been trying to understand ""The Hanf number of the first  order theory of Banach spaces"" by Shelah and Stern (Trans. AMS 244 (1978) 147-241). They construct a normed space $M$ from a Hilbert space $\cal H$ by taking the unit ball of $M$ to be the intersection of that of $\cal H$ with the halfspaces defined by $(x, \pm a) \le 1 - \delta_a$ for certain unit vectors $a$  and small $\delta_a &gt;0$. They then need to show that the $\cal H$-unit ball is definable in $M$ using a first order language with symbols for vector addition and membership of the $M$-unit ball. With this in view, in their Lemma 2.9, they claim certain of the vectors $a$ are definable, but they don't have what they need to apply the lemma they appeal to for this (they have an inequality $\|b\| \le (1 - \delta)^{-1}$ but their Lemma 2.3 needs the opposite inequality).</p>

"<p>My question is basically, does there exist a statement X independent of ZF such that ZF + X implies a statement P of first-order arithmetic, but ZF + not X implies not P?  </p>

<p>Now X cannot be the axiom of constructibility due to Schoenfield's absoluteness theorem, which states that the axiom of constructibility, and thus its consequences like the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis, can't be used to prove any statement of first-order arithmetic that you couldn't already prove using ZF:

<p>Also, there are examples like Con(ZF), but they're not really interesting, because obviously Con(ZF) is a true statement assuming that ZF is sound.  So I'm specifically looking for statements X whose truth value cannot be deduced from the assumption that ZF is sound.</p>

<p>So perhaps a preliminary question should be, does there exist any statement independent of ZF which can prove statements of first-order arithmetic that ZF can't prove, but whose truth value does not follow from the assumption that ZF is sound?</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank You in Advance.</p>

<p>EDIT:  This is based on <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/467017/do-the-axiom-of-choice-and-its-negation-have-contradictory-consequences-for-arit"">a question of mine</a> from Math.Stackexchange:</p>

<p>EDIT 2:  Just to clarify, when I said ""does not follow from the assumption that ZF is sound"", I was speaking metamathematically, I wasn't talking about reasoning within the language of ZF.  I meant that we shouldn't be obliged to believe either X or its negation just because we believe that the axioms of ZF are true.  The axiom of choice is an example of such a statement: if we accept that the axioms of ZF are true, that doesn't compel us to accept either the axiom of choice or its negation.  But unfortunately, the axiom of choice doesn't have any new consequences for first-order arithmetic, outside of what ZF already allows us to prove.  So I want a statement like that that does have consequences for first-order arithmetic.</p>

<p>Still, if people find it too informal to talk about metamathematical reasoning, we can make things more precise by defining the truth predicate of ZF within NBG set theory, as shown in theorem 1 of <a href=""http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm37/fm37110.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">(Mostowski 1950)</a>.  Or, if @JoelDavidHamkins is right and we can't define a truth predicate within NBG, I'm happy to define the truth predicate within Morse-Kelley set theory instead.  But however we formalize it, I hope my intent is clear: I want a statement X such that mathematicians who agree that the axioms of ZF are true can still disagree about whether statement X is true.</p>

<p>EDIT 3:  I've come to realize that consistency statements Con(T) don't satisfy what I'm trying to ask, because the only warrant of their independence from ZF is that we assume that the underlying theory T is in fact consistent.  Because if the theory were inconsistent, then the falsehood of Con(T) could be proven in ZF and even in PA.  The reason for that is that consistency statements are all Pi_1 statements, and every false Pi_1 statement can be proven wrong in PA and thus ZF.  So I want the arithmetical statement P to be higher up in the arithmetical hierarchy than Pi_1.</p>

<p>Now, as @WillSawin has pointed out, it's easy to show that there are truths of first-order arithmetic that are independent of ZF + (All Pi_1 truths), because otherwise an oracle who could decide Pi_1 truths would be able to decide all truths of first-order arithmetic, which is obviously wrong.  So we know that such a statement exists.  But I would prefer to have a concrete statement, not just a proof that a statement exists.  </p>

<p>And more importantly, while I do want P to be a statement of first-order arithmetic, I would prefer that X not be a statement of arithmetic.  I want X to be a set-theoretic statement that's not an arithmetic statement, something like the axiom of choice, the continuum hypothesis, or a large cardinal axiom.  The fundamental intent of my question is, can there be an unfalsifiable disagreement about which set theory is correct, which leads to an unfalsifiable disagreement about which statements of first-order arithmetic are correct?  As noted above, Schoenfield's absolute theorem rules out the axiom of choice  and the continuum hypothesis, and <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/467017/do-the-axiom-of-choice-and-its-negation-have-contradictory-consequences-for-arit/467024#467024"">this answer</a> to my Math.SE question suggests that large cardinals won't work either.  So does anyone know any non-arithmetical set-theoretic statement, independent of ZF, which implies a non-Pi_1 statement of first-order arithmetic that's independent of ZF?</p>

"<p>I'm looking for books that introduce the reader to mathematical logic assuming the perspective of a formalist. 
I've found that many books are more or less written for the platonist - like Kunen's <em>Foundations of Mathematics</em>, where he even implicitly says on pp. 191 that his book, if I understood it right, is primarily written for platonists, but also explains how a formalist would understand his book (in a whopping 3 pages compared to a couple of sentences for platonist view!).</p>

<p>I'm looking for a book that doesn't wait until page 191 to explain this to me, but <em>constantly</em> conveys the formalist viewpoint.<br>
It is important that the books clearly explains the distinction between theory and metatheory and where different theorems of the metatheory live in (e.g. the soundness theorem can be perceived to be a theorem of ZFC since the relevant parts of the metatheory can be coded in ZFC).</p>

<p>I looked at every book from the thread <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/61814/ask-for-recommendations-for-textbook-on-mathematical-logic"">Ask for recommendations for textbook on mathematical logic</a> and <em>none</em> was what I was looking for. Closest to my needs came Kunen - who at least mentions formalism and how his book should be read according to this perspective. This contrasts with other logic books who don't mention anything, and Cori and Lascar's book - for their excellent introduction concerning the vicious circle in what mathematical logic studies - and Goldrei's book on logic, which is not on the list.</p>

<p>To give an explanation for this, perhaps, unusual request: I find it that I understand mathematical theories best when the setting in which the theory ""lives"" in is clearly outlined so that working in that theory is just formal manipulations of symbols - of course I can attach meaning and intuition to these manipulations, but there has to be a ""fixed"" setting to work in. From what I've read this aligns understanding aligns best with the perspective of formalism. But sadly mathematical logic is always somewhat vague and in basic core always seems to be somewhat obscure (Kunen says in the above mentioned book for example on page 190 that </p>

<p>what metatheory is. Now I accept that we can't begin with formal setting based on nothing, because there has to be an informal description of the most basic formal elements of our setting, but I would hope that there are books that explain in more detail that in a single paragraph what metatheory really is. Additionally the lecturer at a course I'm taking also believes in some absolute mathematical objects - I assume he is a platonist - since he frequently says things like ""no, now we're not talking about a formalized version of the natural numbers, we're talking about the <em>real</em> natural numbers"", which totally annoys me because for me, there are no <em>real</em> natural numbers).</p>

"<p>Yesterday I was shocked to discover that <a href=""http://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Logic.FunctionalExtensionality.html"">function extensionality</a> (the statement that if two functions $f$ and $g$ on the same domain satisfy $f\left(x\right) = g\left(x\right)$ for all $x$ in the domain, then $f = g$) is not an axiom in the standard constructive logic of Coq. Of course, one can add it as an axiom in one's files, but it is not obviously available in any pre-defined tactics. I am left wondering...</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> What is the thinking behind considering function extensionality as foreign to the calculus of constructions? I thought that from a computational perspective, a function really <em>is</em> there to be applied to things, and cannot carry any more information than what it does to them (and its type). For a moment I suspected that Coq avoids function extensionality in order to allow applying results to models like arbitrary enriched categories whose internal homomorphisms carry some more information than plain morphisms. But this is not the case: Coq (since version 8.4) has a implementation of eta-expansion (saying that any function $f$ equals the function sending every $x$ in its domain to $f\left(x\right)$, provided the types are right). In an enriched category, this would pour any additional structure of an internal Hom down the drain. (I must say the eta-expansion in Coq feels rather weird, too -- it is triggered by the <code>reflexivity</code> tactic. I expected it to be a tactic on its own...) Having eta-expansion but no extensionality is seriously confusing: one can have $f\left(x\right) = g\left(x\right)$ for all $x$, and yet one cannot rewrite the $f\left(x\right)$ in ""the function sending every $x$ to $f\left(x\right)$"" as a $g\left(x\right)$. And there I thought the bound variable in a lambda term would be like the bound variable in a forall quantification?</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> On a more practical note (and more on-topic in MathOverflow), how much do the axiom of function extensionality and the (weaker) axiom of eta-expansion contribute to the strength of the logic? (At this point I have to admit that I don't really know the definition of the logic involved, so I'll just say I'm talking about the logic of Coq with no additional axioms assumed; it has so far been agreeing with my intuitive understanding of constructivism, until extensionality came along.) If I can define two terms $a$ and $b$ of type $\mathrm{nat}$ (natural numbers) and use function extensionality (resp. eta-reduction, both ways) to prove their equality, can I also do it without? If I can prove a (more complicated) statement using function extensionality, is there a way to transform it into a (possibly clumsier) statement which can be proven without function extensionality and which can be transformed into the former statement using some straightforward applications of function extensionality?</p>

"<p>I have been looking around, unsuccessfully, for generalizations of universal algebra based on higher-order logic (rather than first order) and where the relations are not purely equational.  Motivation:  I need a ""theory of syntax"" for presentations of higher-order, non-equational theories.  Furthermore, I want to be able to specify 'combinators' over these presentations, rigorously.</p>

<p>I am aware of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawvere_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">Lawvere theories</a>, but these are still equational (and neither particularly higher-order, though the multi-sorted generalization seems straightforward enough).  There is a beginning of model theory done in a logical independent way, i.e. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_model_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">model theory over an institution</a>; but that seems to concentrate on the model-theoretic aspects, rather than the universal algebra aspects. Perhaps what I am looking for are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_%28mathematics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">sketches</a>?</p>

<p>[Edit:] From the various answer below, it seems I should be asking the question ""how can I view type theory as a theory of syntax""?  Somehow, that seems like an 'implementation' (as it requires a fair bit of 'encoding'); for example, to express the 'theory of categories' [i.e. (Obj, Mor, id, src, trg, $\circ$) and 5-6 axioms, I need a dependent record.  Plus what is a sort (and sort constructor for Mor), what is an operation, and what is in Prop?  Universal algebra cleanly separates these.</p>

<p>A good question was asked: what theorems do I want?  Well, whatever operations I make on theories, well-formedness of the results will require discharging some obligations -- these obligations should all be finitely expressible (and automatically well-formed).  Furthermore, the resulting syntactic objects and their morphisms should form a finitely co-complete category.  Note that I expect that deciding if a given (presentation of a ) theory has a model to be undecidable.</p>

"<p>DISCLAIMER: All pointclasses considered here are boldface.</p>

<p>Most of the time, when doing descriptive set theory, we want the projective sets to ""behave well;"" for example, maybe we don't want there to be nonmeasurable projective sets, or projective well orderings of $\mathbb{R}$, etc. Generally, this means making some (fairly conservative) large cardinal assumption, or equivalent.</p>

<p>At the far opposite end of things is the axiom that all sets are constructible, $V=L$. This axiom implies that there is a projective - in fact, $\Delta^1_2$ - well-ordering of the reals, and so projective sets become bad very early in the hierarchy. </p>

<p>My question is about the state of affairs when $V=L$ holds. My motivation is simply that I don't feel I have a good grasp on basic concepts in descriptive set theory, and the following seemed like a good test problem to assign myself; but I have thought about it for a while without making progress, so I'm asking here:</p>

<p>Let $\oplus$ be one of the usual pairing operators on $\omega^\omega$. For the purposes of this question, we say that a pointclass $\Gamma\subseteq \mathcal{P}(\omega^\omega)$ has the uniformization property if whenever $A\in \Gamma$, there is some $B\in \Gamma$ such that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$B\subseteq A$, and</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever $x\oplus y\in A$, there is a unique $z$ such that $x\oplus z\in B$.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That is, we view $A$ as coding a relation on $\omega^\omega\times \omega^\omega$, and $B$ is the graph of a function contained in $A$. (This is not usually how uniformization is presented, but it's equivalent for all intents and purposes.) My question is then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assume $V=L$. Let $D$ be the set of (boldface) $\Delta^1_2$ elements of $\omega^\omega$; does $D$ have the uniformization property?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, it seems clear to me that $D$ should <strong>not</strong> have the uniformization property. [EDIT: As Joel's answer below shows, this is completely wrong.] The counterexample should be just the $\Delta^1_2$ well-ordering $\prec$ given by the assumption that $V=L$: uniformizing $\prec$ requires us to choose, for each real $r$, a real $s$ such that $r\prec s$; and although $\prec$ is $\Delta^1_2$, the usual way of doing this - choosing the immediate $\prec$-successor of $r$ - is no longer $\Delta^1_2$.</p>

<p>However, I don't know how to show that $\prec$ - or any other $\Delta^1_2$ set - cannot be uniformized in $\Delta^1_2$. I suspect I'm just missing something fairly simple.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: it is known that the boldface pointclasses $\Pi^1_1$ and $\Sigma^1_2$ have the uniformization property, and assuming large cardinals, the uniformization property can be further propagated to every pointclass $\Pi^1_{2n+1}$, $\Sigma^1_{2n}$. On the other hand, the class $\Delta^1_1$ of Borel sets lacks the uniformization property, provably in $ZFC$.</p>

"<p><em>All structures are countable with countable signature.</em></p>

<p>Given a structure $\mathcal{A}$, the <em>age</em> of $\mathcal{A}$, $Age(\mathcal{A})$, is the set of structures isomorphic to finitely-generated substructures of $\mathcal{A}$ (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_(model_theory)"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_(model_theory)</a>). (This isn't really a set, but we can restrict attention to those structures contained in $H_{\omega_{17}}$, say.) $Age(\mathcal{A})$ automatically satisfies the Joint Embedding and Hereditariness properties, but may lack the Amalgamation property: an example of this is the undirected graph $\mathcal{G}$ with integers as vertices, and an edge between ever pair $(z, z+1)$.</p>

<p>Given a collection $\mathbb{K}$ of finite structures closed under isomorphism with the Joint Embedding, Hereditariness, and Amalgamation properties, we can form the <em>Fraïssé limit</em> of $\mathbb{K}$, the unique homogeneous structure $F(\mathbb{K})$ with $Age(F(\mathbb{K}))=\mathbb{K}$. Specifically, let $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{K})=\mathbb{P}$ be the poset whose elements are finite sequences $\emptyset\prec \mathcal{A}_0\prec . . . \prec\mathcal{A}_n$ of structures in $\mathbb{K}$, ordered by reverse extension; then forcing with $\mathbb{P}$ produces the Fraïssé limit. Formally, there is a countable collection $\mathcal{D}$ of dense sets in $\mathbb{P}$ such that the direct limit of the terms of any $\mathcal{D}$-generic filter through $\mathbb{P}$ is isomorphic to the Fraïssé limit.</p>

<p>Now if $\mathbb{K}$ lacks the Amalgamation property, there will be no homogeneous structure with age $\mathbb{K}$. The poset $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{K})$, however, still makes sense, and we can consider the collection $Fil(\mathbb{K})$ of all structures formed by (taking direct limits of terms of) maximal filters through $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{K})$.</p>

<p>Moreover, we can compare structures in $Fil(\mathbb{K})$ in terms of relative genericity. For $D\subseteq \mathbb{P}(\mathbb{K})$ dense, let $\mathcal{O}_D$ be the set of structures which can be built by filters hitting $D$. These sets $\mathcal{O}_D$ then generate a topology $\tau_\mathbb{K}$ on $Fil(\mathbb{K})$. This space is terrible, but seems reasonably natural if what we're interested in is how generic elements of $Fil(\mathbb{K})$ are. </p>

<p>As it turns out, elements of $Fil(\mathbb{K})$ can be extremely generic, even though the Fraïssé limit as such may not exist. Specifically, let $Gen(\mathbb{K})$ be the class of isomorphism classes of structures $\mathcal{A}$ such that in every open $\mathcal{O}_D$ there is a copy $\mathcal{B}\cong\mathcal{A}$. Then, for example, consider the graph $\mathcal{G}$ from the first paragraph and let $\mathbb{K}=Age(\mathcal{G})$. $Fil(\mathbb{K})$ is precisely the class of acyclic infinite graphs in which each vertex has degree at most 2. However, the graph $\mathcal{G}$ is special among these graphs, since there is a countable collection $\mathcal{D}$ of dense subsets of $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{K})$ such that any $\mathcal{D}$-generic filter corresponds to $\mathcal{G}$. This means $Gen(\mathbb{K})=\{\mathcal{G}\}$, and so in some sense $\mathcal{G}$ is the closest thing to a Fraisse limit of $Age(\mathcal{G})$ as we might reasonably expect to exist.</p>

<p>In general, if $Gen(Age(\mathcal{A}))$ has precisely one element, denote that element by $G(\mathcal{A})$, and call it the <em>generalized Fraïssé limit</em> of $Age(\mathbb{A})$.</p>

<hr>

<p>My questions are as follows. First, the obvious:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are some sources for learning about this construction? In particular, what's it <em>actually</em> called?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When is $Gen(Age(\mathcal{A}))$ nonempty? When does it have exactly one element?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, the fact that $G(\mathcal{G})=\mathcal{G}$ motivates me to ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose $Gen(Age(\mathcal{A}))$ has exactly one element. What can we say about $G(\mathcal{A})$ in relation to $\mathcal{A}$? For example, what structures $\mathcal{A}$ do we have $G(\mathcal{A})=\mathcal{A}$? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A couple quick observations: any homogeneous structure $\mathcal{A}$ will certainly have $G(\mathcal{A})=\mathcal{A}$. On the other hand, consider the graph $\mathcal{G}_\omega$ consisting of the disjoint union of infinitely many copies of $\mathcal{G}$; then $G(\mathcal{G}_\omega)=\{\mathcal{G}\}$, so not every structure has this property even if it has singleton $Gen$. Finally, note that we will always have $G(G(\mathcal{A}))=G(\mathcal{A})$ if $G(\mathcal{A})$ exists.</p>

While Godel's incompleteness theorems state that a consistent system cannot prove its consistency, they do not eliminate proofs using a stronger system or methods that are outside the scope of the system. The paper shows that the cardinalities of infinite sets are uncontrollable and contradictory. The paper then states that Peano arithmetic, or first-order arithmetic, is inconsistent if all of the axioms and axiom schema assumed in the ZFC system are taken as being true, showing that ZFC is inconsistent. The paper then exposes some consequences that are in the scope of the computational complexity theory.</p>

"<p>First, let me say that I have no idea if such a post has its place here. However, I believe that the ideas I'm going to present are important. The goal of this thread is three fold:</p>

<p>1) trying to define morally what is a theory and its stratification process (like set theory) as a collection of higher categories,</p>

<p>2) asking for references about such ideas,</p>

<p>3) listening for constructive criticisms.</p>

<p>To begin, let us notice that the 1-category Sets of all sets cannot discriminate the ""deeper"" layers of sets: by this, I mean that two different sets of the same cardinalities will be isomorphic even though their elements are non isomorphic <strong>sets</strong>. This means that 1-category theory can only see the first layer of structure of an object, but fails to see its construction process (which can, however, be quite important when one is looking at some ""higher level"" concepts).</p>

<p>Yet, if one was following the philosophy that arrows are probing the inner structure of an object, one should instantly conclude that in order to discriminate the elements of a set, and their elements, and so on, infinite category theory is needed. However, how to put such higher categorical structure on Sets? Quite simply, by thinking upside down:
we have to consider that a set is an object, while an element of a set is probed by an 1-cell, while an elements of an element is probed by a 2-cells, and so on up to some $n$ (we call the height of a set the length of the maximum chain of membership of its elements).
With such vocabulary, one needs $n$-category theory in order to probe up to length $n$ sets.</p>

<p>To begin, let us think of a strict $n$-category as something built recursively from $n-1$ categories. An $n$-category has $n+1$ collection of cells such that:
Its ""collection"" of $0$-cell are $n-1$-categories,</p>

<p>Its ""collection"" of $1$-cells are $(n-1)$-$0$-transfor (that is, $(n-1)$-functors),</p>

<p>Its ""collection"" of $2$-cells are $(n-1)$-$1$-transfor (that is, $(n-1)$-natural transformation),
...</p>

<p>Its ""collection"" of $k$-cells are $(n-1)$-$(k-1)$-transfor (for $k \leq n-1$),
...</p>

<p>Its collection of $n$-cells are $(n-1)$-$(n-1)$-transfor.</p>

<p>We also impose that the domain and codomain of an $n$-$k$-transfor is an $n$-$(k-1)$ transfor, and adds all the relevant compositions.</p>

<p>Now, for any $1$-category $\mathcal{C}$, let us define $Pow(\mathcal{C})$ to be the $2$-category whose $0$-cells are the full subcategories of $\mathcal{C}$, $1$-cells are functors between them, and $2$-cells are natural transformations between such functors.</p>

<p>Notice that at this point, with our previous interpretation of $n$-category, taking such ""powercat"" operation doesn't allow us to see deeper inside the inner structure of sets inside Sets (that it, it doesn't see that the elements of a set are sets). Yet, $Pow(Sets)$ clearly contains a terminal category whose object is $1 = \{*\}$ and unique arrow is $Id_*$. In particular, any $1$-cell from $1$ to $A$ is a way to pickup an element in $A$ (say, a set $S$), while any natural transformation between $S_1, S_2: 1 \rightarrow A$ is like picking up an arrow $S_1 \rightarrow S_2$ ""inside"" $A$, without having to know what are the constituting elements of $A$.</p>

<p>Also, say that a map $term: 1 \rightarrow A$ is terminal if it is a terminal object in $Hom(1,A)$ (that is, it picks up the terminal object inside $A$). Any natural transformation from $term$ to $S_1$ is a way to look at the elements of $S_1$ inside $A$ from the outside of $A$. Hence, such natural transformation is nothing else than an element of $A$ in the usual sense : an element of some set that is itself a set, but the latter structure seems to be totally inaccessible from the outside.</p>

<p>Here comes the idea: suppose that we are able to take for all $n$ the $Pow^n(X)$ category where $X$ is some syntactic category, hence is ""at most"" a category representing some sets of height $1$ : the ""formal"" elements of a syntactic object $A$ in $X$ are arrows $1 \rightarrow A$. Yet, these formal elements have no arrows between them because there is no 2-cells ($X$ is a $1$-cat). As a result, $X$ represents a category of sets where elements are structureless (like, urelements?). Now, let us fix some big enough $n$. Clearly, $Pow^n(Sets)$ is a $n+1$-category in the previous sense (arrows are $n$-$k$-transfors, etc). We interpret such category as a category of sets of height at most $n$, where elements are sets of height at most $n-1$, and so on. In particular, what happens if we restrict such category to a $1$-category by forgetting all $n$-$k$-transfors but the $k = 0$th one ? We are forming a $1$-category whose objects are $n$-categories and arrows are $n$-$0$-transfors representing sets of height at least $n$. However, by doing so, we just forgot that our ""elements"" of our categories are actually categories too, and this is exactly what happens when one is looking at Sets as a $1$-category: we forgot that the elements of our elements are sets!</p>

<p>Therefore, one can be tempted to say that the ""real"" category Sets is actually an $\infty$-category built under some operations on categories over a syntactic one $X$. Also, given two $0$-cells $1$ and $A$ of such $\infty$-category interpreted as some sets of some height (1 being the terminal cell), the maximum $n$ such that the $\infty$-$m$-transfors are trivials for $m &gt; n$ is simply the height of the set $A$ for the membership relation. </p>

<p>Following this line of thoughts, it becomes natural to say that a formal theory (like set theory) is a ""collection"" of higher categories ($1$-cat, $2$-cat, $\ldots$, $n$-cat, $\ldots$) that are ""closed"" under the following primitive operations: </p>

<li><p>Powercat operations takes some $n$-category $\mathcal{C}_n$  and send it to the full $(n+1)$-category of all full subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_n$. We write it $Pow(\mathcal{C}_n)$.</p></li>
<li><p>Transfor operations takes two $n$-categories $\mathcal{C}_n$, $\mathcal{D}_n$, and sends them to the full $n$-category of $(n-1)$-transfors $Trans(\mathcal{C}_n, \mathcal{D}_n)$, </p></li>
<li><p>$Downshift_k$ operation for all positive integers $k$: if $\mathcal{C}_n$ is an $n$-category, then for any $0 \leq k &lt; n$, $Downshift_k(\mathcal{C}_n)$ is the $(n-k)$-category whose $m$-cells for $0 \leq m &lt; (n-k)$ are the $k+m$-cells of $\mathcal{C}_n$, </p></li>
<li><p>$Upshift_k$ operation for all positive integers $k$: if $\mathcal{C}_n$ is an $n$-category, then for any $0 \leq k &lt; n$, $Upshift_k(\mathcal{C}_n)$ is the $(n-k)$-category whose $m$-cells for $0 \leq m  &lt; (n-k)$ are the $m$-cells of $\mathcal{C}_n$.</p></li>
<li><p>Lifting operation: if $\mathcal{C}_n$ is an $n$-category, then $Lift(\mathcal{C}_n)$ is formally a $n+1$-category where the $(n+1)$-$n$-transfors are all identities and other cells are left unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>Restriction by subcategories</p></li>
<li><p>Closed under limits inside any $n$-categories containing the previous ones.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Question: Did some people already looked at this kind of things and paradigm? Moreover, can we find a syntactic $1$-category $X$ generating the category nSets, of all sets of height at most $n$ for the membership relation?</p>

<p>edit: Maybe an easier way to ""see"" the whole structure of Sets is as follow: for any set $A$, we define the small category $\mathcal{A}$ generated by the syntactic objects with the same name as the ones of $A$ (say, $a$, $b$, $c$, $\ldots$), plus a terminal element $1$. Now, the arrows of $\mathcal{A}$ are, for any objects $a$, $! : a \rightarrow 1$, and $a: 1 \rightarrow a$ with $! \circ a = Id_{1}$ and no other relations. That is, the arrow $a \circ !$ is an endoarrow that is not equals to the identity.</p>

<p>Call $1Sets$ the $1$-category whose objects are all such categories, and arrows are the functors preserving limits (that is the terminal element) between them. Note that here, the terminal category is initial, while the arrow category $(1 \rightarrow *)$ with one non trivial endoarrow at $*$ is terminal. This category is obviously equivalent to Sets. Now, if one is taking the powercat operation taking as $0$-cells all (non necessarily full actually) subcategories of $1Sets$, as $1$-cells the functors between such subcategories, and as 2-cells the natural transformations, we obtain $2Sets$: the category of all sets of height $2$. In particular, one can easily iterate such constructions by taking $Pow(nSets)$ to obtain $(n+1)$Sets as the $(n+1)$-category of all sets of height $n+1$.</p>

<p>Now, what I tried to express yesterday is that the ""true"" set theory is the ""collection"" of all $n$-categories $nSets$, which can be put together by lifting all nSets categories to infinite-categories where all $m$-cells are trivials for $m &gt; n$.</p>

<p>I hope that it's now clearer.</p>

<p>Further, if we are forcing with a collection of partial functions (as we often do), we want the stronger condition to be the partial function with the larger domain. This leads us to a definition of the poset order whereby $f &lt; g$ iff $f \supset g$. This seems notationally awkward.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3) Can these two proofs of ""RH is equivalent to a $\Pi_1$ sentence"" be formalized in PA?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>Motivation:</h3>

<p>This is mentioned in P. Odifreddi, ""<a href=""https://books.google.ca/books?id=xuvuAAAAMAAJ"">Kreiseliana: about and around George Kreisel</a>"", 1996, page 257. Feferman mentions that when Kreisel was trying to ""unwind"" the non-constructive proof of Littlewood's theorem, he needed to deal with RH. Littlewood's proof considers two cases: there is a proof if RH is true and there is another one if RH is false. But it seems that in the end, Kreisel used a $\Pi_1$ sentence weaker than RH which was sufficient for his purpose.</p>

<h3>Why is this interesting?</h3>

<p>Here I will try to explain why this question was interesting from Kreisel's viewpoint only.</p>

<p>Kreisel was trying to extract an upperbound out of the non-constructive proof of Littlewood. His ""unwinding"" method works for theorems like Littlewood's theorem if they are proven in a suitable theory. The problem with this proof was that it was actually two proofs: </p>

<ol>
<li>If the RH is false then the theorem holds.</li>
<li>If the RH is true then the theorem holds.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I remember correctly, the first one already gives an upperbound. But the second one does not give an upperbound. Kreisel argues that the second part can be formalized in an arithmetic theory (similar to PA) and his method can extract a bound out of it assuming that the RH is provably equivalent to a $\Pi_1$ sentence. (Generally adding $\Pi_1$ sentences does not allow you to prove existence of more functions.) This is the part that he needs to replace the usual statement of the RH with a $\Pi_1$ statement. It seems that at the end, in place of proving that the RH is $\Pi_1$, he shows that a weaker $\Pi_1$ statement suffices to carry out the second part of the proof, i.e. he avoids the problem in this case.</p>

<p>A simple application of proving that the RH is equivalent to a $\Pi_1$ sentences in PA is the following: If we prove a theorem in PA+RH (even when the proof seems completely non-constructive), then we can extract an upperbound for the theorem out of the proof. Note that for this purpose, we don't need to know whether the RH is true or is false.</p>

<p>Note: 
Feferman's article mentioned above contains more details and reflections on ""Kreisel's Program"" of ""unwinding"" classical proofs to extract constructive bounds. My own interest was mainly out of curiosity. I read in Feferman's paper that Kreisel mentioned this problem and then avoided it, so I wanted to know if anyone has dealt with it.</p>

"<p>$1-ab$ invertible $\implies$ $1-ba$ invertible has a slick power series ""proof"" as below, where Halmos asks for an explanation of why this tantalizing derivation succeeds. Do you know one?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Geometric series.</em> In a not necessarily commutative ring with
unit (e.g., in the set of all $3 \times 3$ square matrices with real
entries), if $1 - ab$ is invertible, then $1 - ba$ is invertible. However
plausible this may seem, few people can see their way
to a proof immediately; the most revealing approach belongs
to a different and distant subject.</p>

<p>Every student knows that
$1 - x^2 = (1 + x) (1 - x),$
and some even know that
$1 - x^3 =(1+x +x^2) (1 - x).$
The generalization
$1 - x^{n+1} = (1 + x + \cdots + x^n) (1 - x)$
is not far away. Divide by $1 - x$ and let $n$ tend to infinity;
if $|x| &lt; 1$, then $x^{n+1}$ tends to $0$, and the conclusion is
that
$\frac{1}{1 - x} = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots$.
This simple classical argument begins with easy algebra,
but the meat of the matter is analysis: numbers, absolute
values, inequalities, and convergence are needed not only
for the proof but even for the final equation to make
sense.</p>

<p>In the general ring theory question there are no numbers,
no absolute values, no inequalities, and no limits -
those concepts are totally inappropriate and cannot be
brought to bear. Nevertheless an impressive-sounding
classical phrase, ""the principle of permanence of functional
form"", comes to the rescue and yields an analytically
inspired proof in pure algebra. The idea is to pretend
that $\frac{1}{1 - ba}$ can be expanded in a geometric series (which
is utter nonsense), so that
$(1 - ba)^{-1} = 1 + ba + baba + bababa + \cdots$
It follows (it doesn't really, but it's fun to keep pretending) that
$(1 - ba)^{-1} = 1 + b (1 + ab + abab + ababab + \cdots) a.$
and, after one more application of the geometric series
pretense, this yields
$(1 -ba)^{-1} = 1 + b (1 - ab)^{-1} a.$</p>

<p>Now stop the pretense and verify that, despite its unlawful
derivation, the formula works. If, that is, $ c = (1 - ab)^{-1}$, 
so that $(1 - ab)c = c(1 - ab) = 1,$ then $1 + bca$ is the inverse
of $1 - ba.$ Once the statement is put this way, its
proof becomes a matter of (perfectly legal) mechanical
computation.</p>

<p>Why does it all this work? What goes on here? Why
does it seem that the formula for the sum of an infinite
geometric series is true even for an abstract ring in which
convergence is meaningless? What general truth does
the formula embody? I don't know the answer, but I
note that the formula is applicable in other situations
where it ought not to be, and I wonder whether it deserves
to be called one of the (computational) elements
of mathematics. -- P. R. Halmos [1]</p>

"<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>This is a question I have been asking from long, but none of my colleagues could ever answer me:</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that the axiom of choice (AC) allows one to prove the existence of some set with some property $P$, though we cannot <em>exhibit</em> such a set: for instance, one knows that there exists a well-ordering on $\mathbb{R}$, but cannot define any though.</p>

<p>In formal terms, this means the following: working is the ZFC system, one can find a (first-order) logical property $P(x)$ (with one free variable) such that
$$\vdash (\exists x) (P(x)),$$
yet there is no logical property $Q(x)$ such that
$$\vdash (\exists! x) (P(x) \wedge Q(x))$$</p>

<p>Apparently that is the very phenomenon why many people are dubious about the relevance of AC. Yet I have seen nowhere the statement (and even less the proof) that such a phenomenon would <em>not</em> occur in ZF...</p>

<p><strong>So, is it true that, whenever ZF proves the existence of a set having some property, it is also possible to define some non-ambiguous such set?</strong></p>

<p>Regards,</p>

 <em>Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis</em>
(Page 71) there is a lemma with the assumption that 
$\exists x\, P(x)$.
The ''proof'' there, uses the following argument:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Intuitively the lemma is obvious, since if $F$ is valid it holds for
  every set $S$ in which relations and constants corresponding to the
  formal language are defined and hence for the   subset
    $$\{x|\,x \in S \land P(x)\}.$$
  Thus $F_P$ is true in every model and hence is
  valid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $F$ is a formula, then $F_P$ denotes the formula obtained from $F$
  by adjoining to every variable $x$ the condition $P(x)$. That is in
  building $F_P$, each $\exists x\, B$   becomes
  $$\exists x\,[P(x) \land B]$$ 
  and each $\forall x\, B$ becomes<br>
  $$\forall x\,[P(x) \rightarrow B].$$
  We say $F_P$  is $F$ <em>relativized</em> to the condition
  $P(x)$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, I must be missing something.
But say that $F$ is the following statement 
  $$\exists x\, \lnot P(x)$$
and it holds in some model $M$.
That is $P(x)$ is true for some $x\in M$
and is false for some $x\in M$.
Now for the subset 
  $$B = \{x|\,x \in M \land P(x)\}$$
$F$ clearly fails and $F_P$ cannot be true.</p>

<p>What am I missing? Must $F$ be restricted to certain types of statements?</p>

<hr>

<p>Christian Remling and Noah S.
Explained that $F$ as defined above is not valid.</p>

<p>Still, I would like to get a better intuition of
the lemma mentioned in Paul Cohen's book.
So let's look at another example.</p>

<p>Assuming Peano axioms, say $F$ is
 $$\forall x \exists y\, x &lt; y $$
is it considered valid?</p>

<p>If $F$ is valid, then if $P(x)$ is some property like
  $$x &lt; 5$$
then $F_p$ becomes
  $$\forall x\, [x &lt; 5 \rightarrow \exists y\, (y &lt; 5 \land x &lt; y)].$$
Which is clearly invalid considering $x=4$.</p>

a ''non trivial'' example of a valid statement
that includes $\forall$?</p>

"<p>By ""formal analogies"" between the metamathematics of $\mathsf{ZFC}$/set theory and $\mathsf{PA}$(=Peano Arithmetic)/first order arithmetic, I mean facts such as the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We are considering a first-order theory ($\mathsf{ZFC}$ or $\mathsf{PA}$) motivated as a first-order approximation to a second-order theory (second-order $\mathsf{ZFC}^2$ or $\mathsf{PA}^2$) which is ""more or less"" categorical; because of this, some axioms (the separation and replacement axioms on the one hand, the induction axiom on the other) have to be stated as axiom schemes in the first-order theory.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an interesting hierarchy of formulæ, $\Sigma_n$ or $\Pi_n$, based on alternations of quantifiers (viz.: the arithmetic hierarchy vs. the Lévy hierarchy); at the lowest ($\Delta_0$) level of this hierarchy are formulæ with only ""bounded"" quantifiers.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a uniform truth predicate for any (concrete) given level of the hierarchy, which is built upon some kind of absoluteness of $\Delta_0$ formulæ.  As a related fact, the infinite axiom schemes are naturally stratified along the hierarchy (they can be cut off at the $\Sigma_n$ level and stated as a single formula for each concrete $n$).</p></li>
<li><p>There is a reflection theorem which ensures that any finite set of true statements (or one bounded in the hierarchy of formulæ) is consistent.  In particular, the full theory proves the consistency of the subtheory with the axiom schemes cut off at the $\Sigma_n$ level: that is, the theory ($\mathsf{ZFC}$ or $\mathsf{PA}$) is reflexive.  In fact, it is even <em>essentially</em> reflexive (every consistent extension is reflexive).</p></li>
<li><p>There is a conservative two-kinded extension (Gödel-Bernays on the set theoretical side, $\mathsf{ACA}_0$ on the arithmetical side) which is obtained by allowing formation of classes but only with a comprehension scheme for such classes that does not involve quantifying over classes; remarkably, this conservative two-kinded extension is finitely axiomatizable.  There is also a standard strictly stronger two-kinded extension (Morse-Kelley on the set-theoretical side, second-order arithmetic $\mathsf{Z}_2$ seen as a first-order theory on the arithmetical side).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(I hope I didn't mess things up too much, but all of these facts are standard and can be found in standard textbooks such as Jech's <em>Set Theory</em> for the set-theoretical side and Hájek and Pudlák's <em>Metamathematics of First-Order Arithmetic</em> plus Simpson's <em>Subsystems of Second-Order Arithmetic</em> for the arithmetical side.)</p>

<p>I'm sure many more examples can be found.  Maybe I should also nod to the similarity between proof theory of extensions of $\mathsf{PA}$ by analysing ordinal notations made by collapsing recursively large ordinals, and large cardinal extensions of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ — or maybe not.</p>

<p>Yet as striking as this analogy seems, nobody seems to comment upon it as far as I know.  (At the very least, this seems pedagogically regrettable: I'm sure all of the above statements would be more memorable to students if the analogous statements were made explicit.)</p>

<p>So: is there some deeper truth to be found behind this parallelism?  (Or are all my sample facts just aspects of a single phenomenon?  Or is this just a red herring?)  Might it make sense to bring $\mathsf{ZFC}$ and $\mathsf{PA}$ under an umbrella metatheory so that the above facts can be proved in a common formalism?  At the very least, is there a textbook I missed where the analogy is played out in some detail?</p>

<p>And perhaps more thought provokingly: can one give an example of a completely different kind of theory that is just as similar to $\mathsf{ZFC}$ and $\mathsf{PA}$ as they are to each other?</p>

<p>(I'm of course aware that are also huge differences between $\mathsf{ZFC}$ and $\mathsf{PA}$; but I would tend to say that they make the similarities all the more striking.)</p>

"<p>In §1.12 of the <a href=""http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/"">Homotopy type theory book</a>, it is mentioned that indiscernibility of identicals is a consequence of path induction. More precisely, for each type $C$ dependent over a type $A$, there is a term
$$\mathsf{transport} : \prod_{a_0, a_1 : A} \prod_{p : a_0 =_A a_1} C (a_0) \to C (a_1)$$
such that $\mathsf{transport} (a, a, \mathsf{refl}) \equiv \mathsf{id}_{C (a)}$, which is manifestly an instance of the general path induction principle, which constructs for each type $B$ dependent over $\sum_{a_0, a_1 : A} a_0 =_A a_1$ and each $s : \prod_{a : A} B (a, a, \mathsf{refl})$ a term

The criticism is based on the objection that $A$ could be empty, in which case there is no $x$ to be in $A$.
