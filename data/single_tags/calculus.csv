<p>Attempt: I am not even sure how to start this question.  I had made an attempt but it was getting nowhere when I did it. I found a solution to the question, but I still do not understand what is going on:</p>

<p>Suppose $$ l = \lim_{x\to a}f(x) \geq \lim_{x\to a}g(x) = m$$. Let $$\epsilon = l - m &gt; 0$$ </p>

<p>Then  there is $$\delta &gt; 0 \text{ such that if } 0 &lt;|x-a|&lt;\delta \Rightarrow |l-f(x)|&lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} \text{ and } |m-g(x)| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2}$$ </p>

"<p>Apologizes if I'm missing something in my question or if my question seems trivial; this is my first question on this site. As motivation for my question, consider the following standard first year calculus question.</p>

  <p>Consider this piecewise function:
  $
   f(x) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       ax^2+b &amp; \text{ if } x \le-2\\
       12x-5 &amp; \text{ if } x &gt;-2
     \end{array}
   \right.
$</p>
  
  <p>For what values of $a$ and $b$ will $f(x)$ be differentiable?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To solve this question, I would like to propose the following theorem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$\mathbf{Theorem:}$ A function $f(x)$ is differentiable iff $f'(x)$ is continuous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this theorem is true, then I can solve for $a$ first by noting that:
$
   f'(x) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       2ax &amp; \text{ if } x \le-2\\
       12 &amp; \text{ if } x &gt;-2
     \end{array}
   \right.
$</p>

<p>Thus, since by my theorem $f'(x)$ must be continuous, we have:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \rightarrow -2^-}f'(x) &amp;= \lim_{x \rightarrow -2^+}f'(x)\\
\lim_{x \rightarrow -2^-}2ax &amp;= \lim_{x \rightarrow -2^+}12\\
2a(-2) &amp;= 12\\
-4a &amp;= 12 \\
a &amp;= -3 \\
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>Hence, since differentiability implies continuity, we can solve for $b$ as follows:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \rightarrow -2^-}f(x) &amp;= \lim_{x \rightarrow -2^+}f(x)\\
\lim_{x \rightarrow -2^-}-3x^2+b &amp;= \lim_{x \rightarrow -2^+}12x-5\\
-3(-2)^2+b &amp;= 12(-2)-5\\
b-12 &amp;= -29\\
b &amp;= -17 \\
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>so that our differentiable function is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$$
   f(x) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       -3x^2-17 &amp; \text{ if } x \le-2\\
       12x-5 &amp; \text{ if } x &gt;-2
     \end{array}
   \right.
$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyways.

"<p>Test for convergence the series
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{(n+1)/n}}$$
I'd like to make up a collection with solutions for this series, and any new<br>
solution will be rewarded with upvotes.   Here is what I have at the moment</p>

<p><strong>Method 1</strong> </p>

<p>We know that for all positive integers $n$, $n&lt;2^n$, and this yields
$$n^{(1/n)}&lt;2$$
$$n^{(1+1/n)}&lt;2n$$
Then, it turns out that 
$$\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n} \rightarrow \infty \le\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{(n+1)/n}}$$
Hence
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{(n+1)/n}}\rightarrow \infty$$
<strong>EDIT:</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>

<p>If we consider the maximum of $f(x)=x^{(1/x)}$ reached for $x=e$<br>
and denote it by $c$, then
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{c \cdot n} \rightarrow \infty \le\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{(n+1)/n}}$$</p>

"<p>Suppose $f(x) \in C[a,b]$ and $\varphi(x)$ is Riemann integrable and satisfy : $\int_a^b\varphi(x)\mathscr{dx}=0$.   $\int_a^bf(x)\varphi(x)\mathscr{dx}=0$       can we conclude that $f(x)\equiv c$?</p>

<p><hr>
My approach:</p>

<p>for $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then there exists $M$ and $m$ in $\Bbb{R}$,satisfy: $m \leq f(x) \leq M$,so we have $M-f(x)\geq0$,so I can use the mean value theorem:
$$\int_a^b(M-f(x))\varphi(x)\mathscr{dx}=\mu\int_a^b(M-f(x))\mathscr{dx}=0 \Rightarrow \int_a^b f(x)\mathscr{dx} =M(b-a)$$
where $\inf\varphi(x)\leq\mu \leq \sup \varphi(x)$<br>
use MVT to : $$\int_a^b(f(x)-m)\varphi(x)\mathscr{dx}$$we get $\int_a^bf(x)\mathscr{dx}=m(b-a)$ this implies $m=M$,then $f$ is constant on $[a,b]$</p>

$$A'(x)=\lim_{h\to0} {A(x+h/2)-A(x-h/2) \over h} $$

So at least the result is not completely random (and in particular not depending on problems with the Cesaro/Euler-summation), but my intuition is still unable to grasp this conceptually...

<p>We know $|f|=f^++f^-$ (the positive and negative part of $f$, which are integrable over any $[c,b]$). By Comparison Test, $\int_{a}^{b}f^+dx$ and $\int_{a}^{b}f^-dx$ exist. Hence the improper integral of $f=f^+-f^-$ exists.</p>

This paper may also be of interest to people here : <a href=""http://www.math.uwo.ca/~dborwein/cv/zeta4.pdf"">http://www.math.uwo.ca/~dborwein/cv/zeta4.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>We can expand the log in the integral to obtain three interals, one trivial, the other 2 are not so easy, any ideas? I tried doing the following
$$
\left( \ln 2 +\ln \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \right)^2=\ln^2(2)+\ln^2\sin\frac{\theta}{2}+2\ln (2)\ln \sin\big(\frac{\theta}{2}\big).
$$
We can write I as 
$$
I=\ln^2(2)\int_0^\pi \theta^2d\theta  +\int_0^\pi\theta^2 \ln^2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2}d\theta+2\ln 2 \int_0^\pi\theta^2 \ln \sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}d\theta.
$$
Change of variables $x=\theta/2$ and performing the trivial integral we obtain
$$
I=\frac{\pi^3\ln^2 2}{3}+8\int_0^{\pi/2} x^2 \ln^2 \sin x\, dx+16\ln 2\int_0^{\pi/2} x^2 \ln \sin x \, dx.

"<h3>Problem statement:</h3>

<p>A plane flying with constant speed of 4 km/min passes over a ground radar station at an altitude of 6 km and climbs at an angle of 35 degrees. At what rate, in km/min, is the distance from the plane to the radar station increasing 6 minutes later? </p>

<p>Hint: The law of cosines for a triangle is $c^2=a^2+b^2− 2ab \cos(\theta)$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the sides of length $a$ and $b$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, so following the typical related rates algorithm:</p>

<p>Identify the problem at hand by drawing a picture. I did that. It appears to me that after the plane passes over the ground station, we get an angle between the measures a and b of 90 + 35 degrees. </p>

<p>Now, let's build a table of values:
$$
a = 6\,\mathrm{km}\\
a' = 0 \quad \text{(duh)}\\
b = b'\cdot t = 4\cdot 6 = 24\\
b' = 4\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{min}\\
t' = 6min\\
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{36+24} = 2\sqrt{15} \approx 2.78316\\
c' = ?

<p>$
u = 2ab\cos(\theta)$</p>

<p>$\frac{du}{dt} = \frac{ds}{dt} \cdot \cos(\theta) - \sin(\theta)\cdot(2ab)$</p>

<p>$\frac{ds}{dt} = 0\cdot ab + (a'b + b'a)$</p>

<p>And so now we rewind:
$\frac{du}{dt} = \left[ \left(0 \cdot ab + \left(a'b + b'a \right) \right) \right] \cdot \cos(\theta) - \sin(\theta) \cdot 2ab $</p>

<p>And so: </p>

<p>I'll start of with the definitions of upper and lower Riemann Sums, just to show you where I'm coming from, and so that you can see where any misunderstanding on my part would lie.</p>

$$M_i = \sup\{f(x): x \in [t_{i-1}, t_{i}]\}$$</p>

<p>This is what I did :</p>

<p>Since $f$ is continuous on $[-1,1]$, $m_i = \min\{f(x): x \in [t_{i-1}, t_i]\}$ and $M_i = \max\{f(x): x \in [t_{i-1}, t_i]\}$</p>

<p><strong>Lower Sum</strong> (Incorrectly Evaluated)</p>

<p>$\min(f(x)) = 0$ and occurs on the sub interval $[-\frac{1}{2}]$, this implies $m_i = 0$. But this has to be incorrect as it then implies $L(x^2, \{-1, -\frac{1}{2}, 1\}) = 0$. The correct answer is $\frac{1}{8}$</p>

<p><strong>Upper Sum</strong> (Correctly Evaluated) (EDIT: As it turns out due to a special case of this question)</p>

<p>$\max(f(x)) = 1$ and occurs on the sub-intervals $[-1, -\frac{1}{2}]$ and $[-\frac{1}{2}]$ at $x=-1$ and $x=1$, thus $M_i=1$</p>

<p>However, although my school is good and well-ranked among community colleges, it's still a community college. None of the courses go too in-depth on any of the topics we cover. It's all about teaching us techniques and methods for solving problems (not extraordinarily difficult problems, either). It's not that the instructors aren't good - many are quite good and certainly know their math. But there just isn't time to spend on any individual topics. We covered all of the integration techniques that are taught at this level (with the exception of improper integrals) in about 2 weeks, or 8 class meetings.</p>

<p>I tried a different method then suggested at the link above and would like to know if it's correct and if not what's wrong / missing.</p>

<p>I'll assume the opposite that $\forall \epsilon&gt;0 , f(x) - x &lt; \epsilon$. Also I know that $f(x) - x &gt; 0$ from $f(x) &gt; 0$ so I can deduce that $|f(x)-x| &lt; \epsilon$ that would mean that for any $x \in [0,1]$  the limit of $f$ at that point is $x$, since $f$ is continuous I also know that the limit of $f$ at any $x \in [0,1]$ is $f(x)$ so $f(x)= x$ which is a contradiction to $f(x) &gt; x$ hence there must be at least one $\epsilon$ for which $f(x) - x &lt; \epsilon$</p>

"<p>This question is related to this recent <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/136067/prove-int-ab-fxdx-leq-frace2l-beta-12l-alpha-int-cd-fxdx"">other question</a>, where two intervals $[a,b] $ and $[c,d]$ were considered. Here I ask about a simpler version with just
one interval $[a,b]$.</p>

<p>Consider the following optimization problem : $f$ is a positive continuous function $[a,b] \to ]0,+\infty[$, satisfying the Lipschitz condition $|f(x)-f(y)| \leq L|x-y|$ for any $x,y \in [a,b]$. Given the constraint $\int_{a}^{b}\frac{dt}{f(t)}=\alpha$ (where $\alpha$ is a positive constant), the problem is then to find the maximum (or supremum) value $M$ of $\int_{a}^{b}f(t)dt$ under this constraint, and find the functions for which this maximum is attained, if any.</p>

<p>Although my evidence for this is still incomplete, I believe the maximum is attained when $f$ is a decreasing affine function with coefficient $-L$. In this case,</p>

<p>$$
f(t)=L\bigg(b-t+\frac{b-a}{e^{L\alpha}-1}\bigg), \
\int_a^{b} f(t)dt= L(b-a)^2\bigg(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{e^{L\alpha}-1}\bigg)
$$</p>

<p>By the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, when looking for the maximum we may assume that $f$ is differentiable (we may even assume that $f$ is a polynomial). In this case, one may apply the methods explained in the abovementioned post : $|f'| \leq L$, so $|(f^2)'| =|2ff'| \leq 2L|f|$ and hence $f^2(x) \leq f^2(a)+2LF(x)$, where we put $F(x)=\int_a^x f(t)dt$. So $f(x)=\frac{f^2(x)}{f(x)} \leq \frac{ f^2(a)+2LF(x)}{f(x)}$. Putting $G(x)=f^2(a)+2LF(x)$, we deduce $\frac{G'(x)}{G(x)} \leq \frac{2L}{f(x)}$. integrating between $a$ and $b$, we obtain
${\sf ln}\big(\frac{G(b)}{G(a)}\big) \leq 2L\alpha$. Now $G(a)=f^2(a)$ and
$G(b)=f^2(a)+2L\int_a^b f(t)dt$, so that one finally obtains</p>

<p>$$
\int_a^b f(t)dt \leq \frac{e^{2L\alpha}-1}{2L}f^2(a)

"<p>Suppose that the polynomial function $f(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots +a_0$ has $k_1$ local maximum points and $k_2$ local minimum points. Show that $k_2=k_1+1$ if $n$ is even, and $k_2=k_1$ if $n$ is odd.</p>

<p>Solution to the problem:</p>

<p>Let $l$=$k_1+k_2$ and let $a_l\lt a_{l-1}\lt \cdots a_1$ be all the local maximum and minimum points. <strong>On the intervals between these points $f$ is either decreasing or increasing.</strong> Since $\lim_{x\to \infty}f(x)=\infty$, the function $f$ must be increasing on $(a_1,\infty)$. Thus $a_1$ must be a local minimum point. Consequently, $f$ must be decreasing on $(a_2,a_1)$, which shows that $a_2$ must be a local maximum point. Continuing in this way we see that $a_k$ is a local minimum point if $k$ is odd and a local maximum point if $k$ is even. </p>

<p>Now if $n$ is even, then $a_l$ must be a local minimum point, since $\lim_{x\to -\infty}f(x)=\infty$. Thus $l$ must be odd, so $a_1,a_3,\dots,a_l$ are the local minimum points, and $a_2,\dots, a_{l-1}$ are the local maximum points. Consequently $k_2=k_1+1.$ If $n$ is odd, then $a_l$ must be a local maximum point, since $\lim_{x\to -\infty}f(x)=-\infty$. The same sort of reasoning then shows that $k_1=k_2$. QED.</p>

<p>I don't know how to prove the bold part. It's intuitively clear from the graph of a polynomial, however, I can't give a proof to this. The only information is $f'$ is zero at each $a_i$ and both $f$ and $f'$ are polynomials. I need to show that $f'$ is either positive or negative on these intervals. How can I show this?

One of his examples is the function $f$ defined as 0 if $x$ is irrational and between 0 and 1,  or $\frac{1}{q}$ if $\frac{p}{q}$ is irreducible and between $0 &lt; x &lt; 1$. Here is a copy of his proof from a previous question which I looked at before asking this question: Pedro Tamaroff (<a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/users/23350/pedro-tamaroff"">http://math.stackexchange.com/users/23350/pedro-tamaroff</a>), What exactly is going on when we're finding a limit?, URL (version: 2013-01-10): <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/q/195969"">http://math.stackexchange.com/q/195969</a>. One of the things that I found confusing about the proof <em>Spivak</em> gave was how he was able to conclude that the points at which the limit could be false are finite. Spivak states, ""Let $n$ be a natural number so large that $\frac{1}{n} \leq e$. Notice that the only numbers $x$ for which the limit could be false are $1/2;1/3;2/3;1/4;3/4;...;1/n,...\frac{n-1}{n}$"" </p>

<p>Let's say the epsilon I choose is $1/10$, and my $n = 11$ (both of which satisfy his statement), then the numbers I would have to check would be: $1/2;...;1/11...10/11$. In my mind, however, there are more numbers then the ones stated by Spivak that can be used to show that the limit is false such as $1/12,...11/12;1/13...12/13$, and I don't understand why this is not the case. I recognize the other parts of the proof, except for this.Furthermore, in an example prior to this one, Spivak shows the function $f(x) = 1$ if $x$ is rational and 0 if $x$ is irrational, and states that the limit can not be found which I think I understand, but this ""new"" function has the limit of 0 at all a from $(0,1)$. I think this has to do with the $\frac{1}{q}$ aspect of this ""new"" function, but I don't really understand how or why.

"<p>This is my second question on the exchange. I've been wrestling with this particular problem for several weeks now, ever since I discovered a certain function, which I call the 'grum' function. I don't know if it's ever been discovered before. I'm just doing street math, pretty much.</p>

<p>In any case, the grum function gives the answer to the following question:</p>

<p>Given any right triangle, and any line segment connecting:</p>

<ul>
<li>The vertice of the angle opposite the hypotenuse, and:</li>
<li>Any point p resting on the hypotenuse, where the distance between the point p and the adjacent vertices of the triangle is given as the following ratio:</li>
<li>$d_{1} = \frac{r}{n}$</li>
<li>$d_{2} = r - \frac{r}{n}$</li>
</ul>

<p>The distance of said line segment can be found via the following function:</p>

<p>$$grum_{n}(\theta) \equiv n^{-1}\sqrt{(n-1)^{2}\cos^{2}(\theta) + sin^{2}(\theta)}$$</p>

<p>pronounced ""grum with index 'n' and evaluated at 'theta'"". The proof is fairly simple, and involves a geometric argument involving right triangles inscribed within right triangles, but that's not relevant to the question at the moment. Although, if you guys do want the proof, then I'll provide it.</p>

<p>In any case, however, my problem revolves around taking the indefinite integral of this function. I can take the derivative of grum with respect to theta like so:</p>

<p>$$\frac{d}{d\theta} n^{-1}\sqrt{(n-1)^{2}\cos^{2}(\theta) + \sin^{2}(\theta)}$$
$$\frac{-2(n-1)^{2}\cos(\theta)\sin(\theta) + 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{2n\sqrt{(n-1)^{2}\cos^{2}(\theta) + \sin^{2}(\theta)}}$$</p>

<p>Which, if we multiply the denominator by 'n' and then simplify the expression, we get the nifty equation of:</p>

<p>$$\frac{d}{d\theta} grum_{n}(\theta) \equiv \frac{\sin(2\theta)(1 - (n-1)^{2})}{2n^{2}grum_{n}(\theta)}$$</p>

<p>So far, so good! However, I got stuck when I tried to take the indefinite integral of this function. I really want to learn not just what the indefinite integral is, but how to get it, and why it works. In any case, here's what I've gotten so far.</p>

<p>First, I draw out the constant in front of the radical, and rewrite the exponents.</p>

<p>$$n^{-1}\lmoustache ((n-1)^{2}\cos^{2}(\theta) + \sin^{2}(\theta))^{\frac{1}{2}}d\theta$$</p>

<p>Next, I rewrite $\sin^{2}(\theta)$ in the form of $1 - \cos^{2}$ and simplify the expression, which yields:</p>

<p>$$n^{-1}\lmoustache((n-1)^{2}\cos^{2}(\theta) - \cos^{2}(\theta) + 1)^{\frac{1}{2}}d\theta$$
$$n^{-1}\lmoustache(\cos^{2}(\theta)((n-1)^{2} - 1)) + 1)^{\frac{1}{2}}d\theta$$</p>

<p>Then I use the trig substitution identity $\sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}x^{2}} = \frac{a}{b}\tan(x)$ to get the following form:</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{n\sqrt{((n-1)^{2}-1) + 1)}}\lmoustache\tan(cos^{2}(\theta))d\theta$$</p>

<p>And... here's where I get stuck. How in hell does one calculate the indefinite integral of $\tan(cos^{2}(\theta))$? Am I even doing this the right way? In using the trigonometric substitution, I simply inserted $\cos^{2}(\theta)$ where x would have gone, but there's no guarantee that that's a valid operation.</p>

<p>If I could get some guidance, or even just a push in the right direction, I would be grateful. In the meantime, I'll keep working on it, and let you guys know if I make any progress on it.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long question, haha. I hope it was at least interesting in some small way, and I thank you very much for your time.</p>

<p>Thank you very much,</p>

"<p>How to evaluate the $\displaystyle\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac {2\sin(x)-\arctan(x)-x\cos(x^2)}{x^5}$, using power series? </p>

<p>It made sense to first try and build the numerator using power series that are commonly used: </p>

<p>$\displaystyle2\sin(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \dfrac{2(-1)^kx^{2k+1}}{2k+1!} = 2x -\frac{x^3}{3}+\frac{x^6}{60} + \dotsb$</p>

<p>$\displaystyle-x\cos(x^2)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \dfrac{(-1)^{k+1}x^{4k+1}}{2k!} = -x +\frac{x^5}{2}+ \dotsb$</p>

<p>Hence, </p>

<p>$\displaystyle\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac {2\sin(x)-\arctan(x)-x\cos(x^2)}{x^5} =

"<p>I am starting out with the following:</p>

<p>$$
\frac{d^n}{dx^n}[g(x)^{f(x)}] = \sum_{c=0}^n g(x)^{f(x)-c}\lambda_{n,c}(x)
$$</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<p>$$
\frac{d^{n+1}}{dx^{n+1}}[g(x)^{f(x)}] = \sum_{c=0}^{n+1}g(x)^{f(x)-c}\lambda_{n+1,c}(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\sum_{c=0}^n g(x)^{f(x)-c}\lambda_{n,c}(x)
$$</p>

<p>$\lambda_{n,c}(x)$ is defined like so:</p>

<p>$$
\lambda_{n,c}(x) = \sum_{k=c}^n \sum_{j=0}^{k-c} {k-c \choose j} \ln(g(x))^{k-c-j} \frac{d^j}{df^j}[f(x)_c] B_{n,k}^{(f \diamond g)^c}(x)
$$</p>

<p>My goal is to find a recurrence relation for $B_{n,k}^{(f \diamond g)^c}(x)$ by setting the two expressions equal to eachother. This is my work so far:</p>

<p>$$
\frac{d}{dx}[g(x)^{f(x)-c} \lambda_{n,c}(x)] = \left((f(x)-c)\frac{g'(x)}{g(x)} + \ln(g(x)) f'(x)\right)g(x)^{f(x)-c} \lambda_{n,c}(x) + g(x)^{f(x)-c} \frac{d}{dx}[\lambda_{n,c}(x)]
$$
Note from now on i will denote $\frac{d^j}{df^j}[f(x)_c] = f_c^{(j)}$
$$
\frac{d}{dx}[\lambda_{n,c}(x)] = \sum_{k=c}^n \sum_{j=0}^{k-c} {k-c \choose j} \left(\frac{g'(x)}{g(x)}(k-c-j) \ln(g(x))^{k-c-j-1} f_c^{(j)} B_{n,k}^{(f \diamond g)^c} + \ln(g(x))^{k-c-j} \frac{d}{dx}[f_c^{(j}B_{n,k}^{(f \diamond g)^c}]\right)
$$</p>

<p>Now, for me to find an expression that will result in a recurrence relation i am going to attempt to group all the $\ln(g(x))^{k-c-j}$ together and set all these terms equal to:</p>

<p>$$
\sum_{c=0}^{n+1} g(x)^{f(x)-c} \lambda_{n+1,c}(x)
$$</p>

<p>By doing this i will have found a way to isolate the $g(x)^{f(x)-c}$ terms as well as the $\ln(g(x))^{k-c-j}$ terms.</p>

<p>To do this i will seperate each individual term and attempt to manipulate it in order to fit these conditions:</p>

<p>$$
A = f'(x) \ln(g(x)) \lambda_{n,c}(x) = f'(x) \sum_{k=c}^n \sum_{j=0}^{k-c} {k-c \choose j} \ln(g(x))^{k-c-j+1} f_c^{(j)} B_{n,k}^{(f \diamond g)^c}(x) = f'(x) \sum_{k=c+1}^{n+1} \sum_{j=0}^{k-c-1} {k-c-1 \choose j} \ln(g(x))^{k-c-j} f_c^{(j)} B_{n,k-1}^{(f \diamond g)^c}(x)
$$
Now,for $B$ i will shift over a step backwards so that instead of $c$ we will be dealing with $c-1$, this is because of the differentiation of the natural log which in turn results in $\frac{g'(x)}{g(x)}$. When we multiply $\frac{g'(x)}{g(x)}$ with $g(x)^{f(x)-c}$ we will get $g'(x) g(x)^{f(x)-c-1}$ therefore by evaluating the expression at $c-1$ we will be evaluating the part of the summation that is dealing with $g(x)^{f(x)-c}$ instead of dealing with the summation that deals with $g(x)^{f(x)-c-1}$. If there is any questions about this please do not hesitate to ask in the comments.
$$
B = g'(x) (f(x)-c+1) \lambda_{n,c-1}(x) = g'(x) (f(x)-c+1) \sum_{k=c-1}^n \sum_{j=0}^{k-c+1} {k-c+1 \choose j} \ln(g(x))^{k-c-j+1} f_{c-1}^j B_{n,k}^{(f \diamond g)^{c-1}}(x) = g'(x) (f(x)-c+1) \sum_{k=c}^{n+1} \sum_{j=0}^{k-c} {k-c \choose j} \ln(g(x))^{k-c-j} f_{c-1}^j B_{n,k-1}^{(f \diamond g)^{c-1}}(x)
$$
Now, for $C$ and $D$ i will split up the two parts in the part where i differentiated the $\lambda_{n,c}(x)$, in variable $C$ we will be using the same logic as i used for ""shifting"" the $c$ variable to $c-1$.</p>

<p>$$
C = \lambda_{n,c}'(x)_{part \space 1} = g'(x)\sum_{k=c-1}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^{k-c+1} {k-c+1 \choose j} (k-c-j+1) \ln(g(x))^{k-c-j} f_{c-1}^{(j)} B_{n,k}^{(f \diamond g)^{c-1}}(x) = g'(x)\sum_{k=c}^{n+1} \sum_{j=0}^{k-c} {k-c \choose j} (k-c-j) \ln(g(x))^{k-c-j} f_{c-1}^{(j)} B_{n,k}^{(f \diamond g)^{c-1}}(x)
$$
Now for $C$ i did a little bit of trickery, first of all, when $k=c-1$ the term is equal to zero due to the $(k-c+1)$ term and when $j = (k-c+1)$ the term is equal to zero due to the $(k-c-j+1)$ term.
$$
D = \lambda_{n,c}'(x)_{part \space 2} = \sum_{k=c}^n \sum_{j=0}^{k-c} {k-c \choose j} \ln(g(x))^{k-c-j} \frac{d}{dx}[f_c^{(j)} B_{n,k}^{(f \diamond g)^c}(x)]
$$</p>

<p>Now the problem arises when i try to add $A+B+C+D$ and set it equal to $\lambda_{n+1,c}(x)$. i have attempted to do this many times but i have hit some points where it becomes troubling or that the identity does now work at all. If someone can please help me with the issue it would be alot of help to me. Thank you all for reading this if you have gotten this far, i appreciate it a lot.</p>

"<p>One of the first things ever taught in a differential calculus class:</p>

<ul>
<li>The derivative of $\sin x$ is $\cos x$.</li>
<li>The derivative of $\cos x$ is $-\sin x$.</li>
</ul>

<p>This leads to a rather neat (and convenient?) chain of derivatives:</p>

<pre>
sin(x)
cos(x)
-sin(x)
-cos(x)
sin(x)
...
</pre>

<p>An analysis of the shape of their graphs confirms <em>some</em> points; for example, when $\sin x$ is at a maximum, $\cos x$ is zero and moving downwards; when $\cos x$  is at a maximum, $\sin x$ is zero and moving upwards.  But these ""matching points"" only work for multiples of $\pi/4$.</p>

<p>Let us move back towards the original definition(s) of sine and cosine:</p>

<p>At the most basic level, $\sin x$ is defined as -- for a right triangle with internal angle $x$ -- the length of the side opposite of the angle divided by the hypotenuse of the triangle.</p>

<p>To generalize this to the domain of all real numbers, $\sin x$ was then defined as the Y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle that is an angle $x$ from the positive X-axis.</p>

<p>The definition of $\cos x$ was then made the same way, but with adj/hyp and the X-coordinate, as we all know.</p>

<p>Is there anything about this <strong>basic</strong> definition that allows someone to look at these definitions, alone, and think, ""Hey, the derivative of the sine function with respect to angle is the cosine function!""</p>

<p>That is, from <strong>the unit circle definition alone</strong>.  Or, even more amazingly, the <strong>right triangle definition alone</strong>.  Ignoring graphical analysis of their plot.</p>

<p>In essence, I am asking, essentially, ""Intuitively <em>why</em> is the derivative of the sine the cosine?""</p>

"<p>I've sort of gotten a grasp on the Chain rule with one variable.  If you hike up a mountain at 2 feet an hour, and the temperature decreases at 2 degrees per feet, the temperature would be decreasing for you at $2\times 2 = 4$ degrees per hour.</p>

<p>But I'm having a bit more trouble understanding the Chain Rule as applied to multiple variables.  Even the case of 2 dimensions </p>

"<h2><strong>Derivation/equation for solid angle factor correction</strong></h2>

<p><strong><em>Summary</em></strong>: I want to determine a correction for the Solid Angle Factor (SAF) due to partially overlapping 'outer' spheres (of different sizes), as perceived/viewed from the center of a 'central' sphere. The distances of these spheres from the 'central sphere' are not equal, i.e. they are not equidistant. The coordinates, distances and relatives angles of all the spheres can be determined via software, i.e. they are known.</p>

<hr>

<p>“The Solid Angle Factor (SAF) is defined as the solid angle of the ligand cone comprising the metal at the apex and the primary coordinating atom or group (the first-order SAF) or the whole ligand (the second-order SAF) divided by 4π. <strong>Geometrically, it refers to the ratio of the projected area to 4π, i.e. the area of the sphere surface.</strong> It actually represents the size of the ligand as viewed from the metal centre towards the ligand. The sum of the values of SAF of all the ligands coordinated to the metal centre represents the total occupancy of the ligands in the coordination sphere. It is apparent that this occupancy should not reach unity because there are gaps and holes among the ligands.” (Polyhedron Vol. 6, No. 5, pp. 104-1048, 1987) (See <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/g2f97bn97yq56vu/xi-zhang1987.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/g2f97bn97yq56vu/xi-zhang1987.pdf?dl=0</a>)</p>

<p>In other words the solid angle is related to the projection of an 'outer' 'ligand' (sphere of known radius) onto the surface of a central ('metal' atom) sphere, as viewed from the center of the central sphere.
<strong>Solid angle factor (SAF) equation</strong>:</p>

<p>$$SAF=\frac{2\pi (1-\cos \Theta )}{4\pi } = \frac{1}{2}(1-\cos \Theta)$$</p>

<p>$$\theta =\sin^{-1}(\frac{\nu }{\iota })$$</p>

<p>, where ν = radius of the sphere of ligand/coordinating atom (This is known),
l = distance between the center of the 'ligand' spheres to the center of the metal atom/ 'sphere'.</p>

<p>A correction (approximation) has been supplied for the case where 2 identical  'ligand' spheres (i.e. the spheres have identical radii) are partially overlapping and are equidistant from the metal center:</p>

<p>$$\Delta SAF = \frac{2(\frac{2\varphi (\pi \nu ^{2})}{360}-d\nu \sin \varphi )}{4\pi (\iota \cos \eta )^{^{2}}}$$</p>

<p>(See link above and the following link:

These diagrams/equations illustrate what I understand of the the given correction equation, as well as the definition of the above symbols)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Derivation/equation for solid angle factor correction</strong>:
However, since there are multiple 'ligand' spheres around the metal several may partially overlap (or be perceived to overlap as viewed from the central 'metal' sphere) due to their close proximity to the metal, thereby resulting in the ‘observed’ solid angle factor being different from the calculated solid angle factor (without correction) from the metal.
The correction must consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>The distance from the central 'metal' sphere to the center of each 'ligand' sphere. (They are not necessarily equidistant)</li>
<li>The radius of each 'ligand' sphere (since they may have different (known) radii).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How would such an equation be derived and what would the equation be?</strong> Perhaps by considering 2 'ligand' spheres at a time? I am interested in the corrected (i.e. accurate) sum of all the SAF (known as the <strong>Solid Angle Sum (SAS)</strong>) of all the surrounding 'ligand' spheres, which should be &lt; or = 1.0.</p>

<p>My try: For fixed $x,y\in S$ define the multi-function $F:[0,1]\rightrightarrows\mathbb{R}^2$, $$F(t):=\cup\{bd\mathscr{C}\cap S\mid tx+(1-t)y\in bd\mathscr{C}\ {\rm and}\ \mathscr{C}\ {\rm is\ a\ convex\ set\ that\ contains\ } x \ {\rm in\ its\ interior}\}$$</p>

<p>If one could use a continuous selection theorem to get a continuous selection of $F$ then it would be done. Unfortunately, I cannot show that, for example, $F$ has convex values to use Michael's selection theorem. </p>

<p>Basically they define three vertices of a facet: $x_k, x_{k'},x_{k''}$

<p>So far so good. The problem is then that they need to compute $\frac{\partial n_i}{\partial x_k}$.

Therefore, this will ensure that the sum of the areas of the rectangles of $f(x)$ will always be less than or equal to the sum of the areas of the rectangles of $g(x)$, thus making the entire area under $f(x)$ $\le$ to that of $g(x)$.</p>

"<p>I am working on computing phase diagrams for alloys.  These are
blueprints for a material that show what phase, or combination of
phases, a material will exist in for a range of concentrations and
temperatures (see <a
href=""http://web.cos.gmu.edu/~tstephe3/talks/SIAMMaterialsScience2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this
pdf presentation</a>).  </p>

<p>The crucial step in drawing the boundaries that separate one phase
from another on these diagrams involves minimizing a free energy
function subject to basic physical conservation constraints.  I am
going to leave out the chemistry/physics and hope that we can move forward
with the minimization using Lagrange multipliers. </p>

<p>The free energy that is to be minimized is this:</p>

<p>$\widetilde{G}(x_1, x_2) = f^{(1)}G_{1}(x_1) + f^{(2)}G_{2}(x_2),$</p>

<p>subject to:</p>

<p>$f^{(1)}x_1 + f^{(2)}x_2 = c_1,$</p>

<p>$f^{(1)} + f^{(2)} = 1. $</p>

<p>(and also that the $x_{i} > 0$ and $f^{(i)} > 0$, for $i=1,2$.)</p>

<p>The Lagrange formulation is:</p>

<p>$L(x_1,x_2,f^{(1)},f^{(2)},\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3) =
f^{(1)}G_{1}(x_1) + f^{(2)}G_{2}(x_2)$  </p>

<p>$- \lambda_{1}(f^{(1)}x_1 + f^{(2)}x_2 - c_1)$</p>

<p>$- \lambda_{2}(f^{(1)} + f^{(2)} - 1) $</p>

<p>The minimization of $\widetilde{G}$ follows from finding the $x_{i}$'s  that satisfy $\nabla L = 0:$</p>

<p>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{1}}   = f^{(1)}G_{1}'(x_1) - \lambda_{1}f^{(1)} = 0$</p>

<p>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_2}     = f^{(2)}G_{2}'(x_2) - \lambda_{1}f^{(2)} = 0$</p>

<p>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial f^{(1)}} = G_{1}(x_1) - \lambda_{1}x_{1} - \lambda_2 = 0$</p>

<p>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial f^{(2)}} = G_{2}(x_2) - \lambda_{1}x_{2} - \lambda_2 = 0$</p>

<p>which yields:</p>

<p>$(*) f^{(1)}\left[G_{1}'(x_1) - \lambda_1 \right] = 0$       </p>

<p>$(**) f^{(2)}\left[G_{2}'(x_2) - \lambda_1 \right]= 0 $       </p>

<p>$(***) G_{1}(x_1) - G_{2}(x_2) = \lambda_1 \left[ x_1 - x_2\right]$ </p>

<p>Because $f^{(1)}$ and $f^{(2)}$ are not to be zero, from (*) and (**) we have that </p>

<p>$G_{1}'(x_1) = G_{2}'(x_2) = \lambda_{1}.$</p>

<p>And, a manipulation of equation (***) looks like </p>

<p>$\frac{G_{1}(x_1) -G_{2}(x_2)}{x_1 - x_2} = \lambda_{1}.$</p>

<p>Now, think of $G_{i}$ as an even degree polynomial (which it isn't, but
it's graph sometimes resembles one) in the plane.  Let the points $x_1$
and $x_2$ be locations along the x-axis that lie roughly below the
minima of this curve.  The constraints (*),(*<em>), and (*</em>*) describe the
condition that the line drawn between $(x_1,G_{1}(x_1))$ and $(x_2,G_{2}(x_2))$ form a common tangent
to the ""wells"" of the curve.  It is these points $x_1$ and $x_2$,
which represent concentrations of pure components in our alloy, that
become mapped onto a phase diagram.  It is essentially by repeating this procedure for many
temperatures that we can trace out the boundaries in the desired phase diagram.</p>

<p><strong>The question is:</strong>  Looking at this from a purely analytic geometry
perspective, <strong>how would one derive the ""variational"" approach to find a common tangent line that we seem to have found using the above Lagrangian?</strong>  (warning: I don't really know how to
model things using variational methods.)  </p>

<p><strong>And, secondly:</strong> I have presented a model of a binary alloy, meaning
two variables to keep track of representing concentrations.  I have
been working on ternary alloys, where this free energy $\widetilde{G}$
is a function of three variables (two independent: $x_1,x_2,x_3$,
where $x_3 = 1- x_1 - x_2$) and is therefore a surface over a Gibbs
triangle.  Then $\nabla L = 0$ produces partial derivatives that no
longer ""speak geometry"" to me, although the solution is a common tangent
plane.  (I have attempted to characterize a common tangent plane
based purely in analytic geometry - completely disregarding the
Lagrangian - and have come up with several relations between
directional derivatives... <strong>How might directional derivatives relate
to the optimality conditions set forth by the Lagrangian?</strong>)</p>

Actually, one can simply consider ${\bf t}\cdot\nabla n_1=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}n_1({\bf r}(s,t))|_{s=0,t=0}$. This is only determined by the values of $n_1$ on the surface. Then, ${\bf t}\cdot\nabla{\bf n}$ is independent of the extension.</p>

<p>Then, let's consider $g=({\bf t}\cdot\nabla{\bf n})\cdot{\bf s}-({\bf s}\cdot\nabla{\bf n})\cdot{\bf t}=[{\bf t}\cdot(\nabla{\bf n}-\nabla{\bf n}^T)]\cdot{\bf s}
=-{\bf t}\cdot[(\nabla\times{\bf n})\times{\bf s}]=-(\nabla\times{\bf n})\cdot{\bf n}$ at ${\bf 0}$, which should be independent of the extension as well.</p>

<p>Let's use the extension ${\bf n}=\nabla\varphi/|\nabla\varphi|$. Then, $\nabla\times{\bf n}=\nabla(1/|\nabla\varphi|)\times\nabla\varphi$ which is perpendicular with ${\bf n}$. This means $g=0$ or ${\bf n}\cdot(\nabla\times{\bf n})=0$ on the surface for any extension.</p>

<p>However, consider ${\bf v}=(x-z,y-z,-2z)$. At point, $(1,0,0)$, in a neighborhood, we can find a smooth surface such that ${\bf v}/|{\bf v}|$ is the normal vector of that surface. This seems to suggest ${\bf v}\cdot(\nabla\times({\bf v}/|{\bf v}|))=0$ at $(1,0,0)$. This means
$\frac{1}{|{\bf v}|}{\bf v}\cdot(\nabla\times{\bf v})=0$. One can verify directly that this is not true. Where does the argument fail?</p>

  <p>Definition: A partition of the interval $[a, b]$ is a <strong>finite</strong> collection of points in $[a, b]$, one of which is $a$ and one of which is $b$. The points in a partition can be numbered $t_0, ...., t_n$ such that $a = t_0 &lt;t_1 &lt; ... &lt; t_{n-1} &lt; t_n =b$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've quoted the above definition of a partition for a reason, as you will see soon. From the definition of a partition, with $P = \{t_0, t_1, ... , t_n{-1}, t_n \}$ we can define the lower and upper Riemann Sums like so:</p>

<p>$$L(f, P) := \sum_{i=1}^{n}m_i(t_i - t_{i-1})$$
$$U(f, P) := \sum_{i=1}^{n}M_i(t_i - t_{i-1})$$
where
$$m_i = \inf\{f(x): t_{i-1} \leq x \leq t_i\}$$
$$M_i = \sup\{f(x): t_{i-1} \leq x \leq t_i\}$$</p>

<p>So essentially what the partition is doing, is selecting <em>sampling points</em> to break up the real field over the interval $[a, b]$ into $n$ sub-intervals, $[t_0, t_1],\  [t_1, t_2],\  ...\ , \ [t_{n-2}, t_{n-1}], \ [t_{n-1}, t_{n}]$, correct?</p>

<p>Is is then mathematically correct to rewrite $m_i$ and $M_i$ as the following:</p>

<p>$$m_i = \inf\{f(x): x \in [t_{i-1}, t_i]\}$$
$$M_i = \sup\{f(x): x \in [t_{i-1}, t_i]\}$$</p>

<p>where $[t_{i-1}, t_i] \subset \mathbb{R}$. (and where $[t_{i-1}, t_i]$ is a continuous interval)? </p>

<p>And if $f$ is assumed to be continuous, then $m_i = \min\{f(x) : x \in [t_{i-1}, t_{i}]\}$, and $M_i = \max\{f(x) : x \in [t_{i-1}, t_{i}]\}$ (in words: $m_i$ will be the minimum value $f$ takes on over the $n$ sub-intervals and $M_i$ will be the maximum value $f$ takes on over the $n$ sub-intervals)?</p>

<p>If what I've said above is correct, just out of curiosity why is the $a \leq x \leq b$ notation preferred over the interval notation $x \in [a, b]$?</p>

<hr>

<p>I really do apologize if what I'm writing is blatantly obvious, I asked a question earlier, and I think only now I realized that what the partition was doing, was just selecting sampling points to break up the real field into sub-intervals.</p>

"<p>I was coming back from my Driver's Education class, and something mathsy really stuck out to me.</p>

<p>One of the essential properties of a car is its current speed.  Or speed at a current time.  For example, at a given point in time in my drive, I could be traveling 40 mph.  But what does that <em>mean</em>?</p>

<p>From my basic algebra classes, I've learned that speed = distance/time.  So if I travel ten miles in half an hour, my average speed would be $20$ mph ($\frac{10 mi}{25 h}$).</p>

<p>But instantaneous velocity...you aren't measuring average speed for a given amount of time.  You're measuring instantaneous speed over an...instantaneous amount of time.</p>

<p>That would be something like (miles) / (time), where time = $0$?  Isn't that infinite?</p>

<p>And perhaps, in a difference of time = $0$, then I'd be travelling $0$ miles.  So would I be said to be going $0$ mph at an instantaneous moment in time?  I'd like to be able to tell that to any cops pull me over for ""speeding""!</p>

<p>But then if miles = $0$ and time = $0$, then you have $\frac00$?</p>

<p>This is all rather confusing.  What does it <strong>mean</strong> to be going $40$ mph at a given moment in time, exactly?</p>

<p>Let $f(x)=a\sin x+b\cos x-\cos x\sin x$, we have $f^\prime(x)=a\cos x-b\sin x-\cos2x$. It seems no advance to calculate the derivative, because $f^\prime$ is as hard as $f$.</p>

<p>Let $u=\cos x$ and $v=\sin x$, we have $u^2+v^2=1$ and $av+bu=uv$. We can work on these equations, but I prefer the trigonometric way, i.e, analyze the properties of $f(x)$.</p>

<p>My approach is in finding something similar to $\displaystyle\left(\frac{x}{2-x}\right)^3$ to which I can easily find the power series representation of. </p>

<p>I use $\displaystyle\frac{1}{2-x}$, noting that $\displaystyle\left(\frac{1}{2-x}\right)'=\frac{1}{(2-x)^2} \text { and } \left(\frac{1}{2-x}\right)''=\frac{2}{(2-x)^3}$.</p>

$$\displaystyle \frac{1}{2-x}=\int\frac{1}{(2-x)^2}dx \iff \frac{1}{2}\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^n=\int\frac{1}{(2-x)^2}dx$$</p>

<p>and differentiating both sides, I get the power series representation of the first derivative</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{2}\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}n\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{n-1}=\frac{1}{(2-x)^2}$$</p>

<p>for the second derivative, </p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{(2-x)^2}=\int\frac{2}{(2-x)^3} \iff \frac{1}{2}\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}n\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{n-1}=\frac{1}{2}\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}(n+1)\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^n=\int\frac{2}{(2-x)^3}dx$$</p>

<p>differentiating both sides, I get the power series representation of the second derivative</p>

<p>$$\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}(n+1)n\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{n-1}=\frac{2}{(2-x)^3}$$</p>

<p>Is this so far correct? If it is, in the end I would multiply the power series representation of $\displaystyle\frac{2}{(2-x)^3}$ by $\displaystyle\frac{x^3}{2}$ to cancel out the $2$ and get the power series for $\displaystyle\left(\frac{x}{2-x}\right)^3$.</p>

  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Consider partitioning $f(x)=x^2$ on $[-1,1]$ into $n$equal sub-intervals. We seek to derive an expression for $L(f, P)$ and $U(f, P)$ in terms of $n$, where $n$ is even.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now the question seemed a bit vague to me, but non the less this is what I did and arrived at:</p>

<hr>

<p>Given $P = \{x_0, x_1, ..., x_n \}$</p>

<p>$$L(f, P) := \sum_{i=1}^{n}m_i(x_i - x_{i-1})$$
$$U(f, P) := \sum_{i=1}^{n}M_i(x_i - x_{i-1})$$
where
$$m_i = \inf\{f(x): x \in [x_{x-1}, x_i]\}$$
$$M_i = \sup\{f(x): x \in [x_{i-1}, x_{i}]\}$$</p>

<p>Now since we wish to partition $f$ over $[-1, 1]$ into $n$ <strong>equal</strong> sub-intervals</p>

<p>$$\implies L(f, P) = (x_n - x_{n-1})\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_i$$
$$\implies U(f, P) = (x_n - x_{n-1})\sum_{i=1}^{n}M_i$$</p>

<p>And since we know $n$ is even, $\exists k \ni 2k =n$. This allows us to break our partition $P$ into two separate partitions $P_1$ and $P_2$ over two intervals $[-1, 0]$ and $[0, 1]$. Thus</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}P_1 &amp;= \{x_1, x_2, ...., x_k\} \ &amp; \text{where} &amp;&amp; \ x_1 = -1 &lt; x_2 &lt; ... &lt; x_k = 0 \\
P_2 &amp;= \{x_{k}, x_{k+1}, ...., x_{2k}\} \ &amp; \text{where} &amp;&amp; \ x_k = 0 &lt; x_{k+1} &lt; ... &lt; x_{2k} = 0
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Since $f$ is continuous on $[-1,1]$, $m_i = \min(f : [x_{n-1}, x_n] \to \mathbb{R})$ and $M_i = \max(f : [x_{n-1}, x_n] \to \mathbb{R})$. </p>

<p>Therefore for $P_1$: $m_i = f(x_n)$ and $M_i = f(x_{n-1})$, and for $P_2$: $m_i = f(x_{n-1})$ and $M_i = f(x_n)$. </p>

<p>Finally putting all this together allows us to rewrite $L(f, P)$ and $U(f, P)$ as follows:</p>

<p>$$\implies L(f, P) = (x_n - x_{n-1})\left(\sum_{n=1}^{k}f(x_n) + \sum_{n=k}^{2k}f(x_{n-1})\right)$$</p>

<h2>$$\implies U(f, P) = (x_n - x_{n-1})\left(\sum_{n=1}^{n}f(x_{n-1}) + \sum_{n=k}^{2k}f(x_{n})\right)$$</h2>

<p>But I'm assuming when they say 'derive an expression' they want a closed form solution for the Riemann Sum,and I'm not sure how to convert what I've arrived at into a closed form, or if it is even possible to convert into closed form as the summand is varying.</p>

<p>I came up with a bit of a solution but there must be an easier way. Also, I'd like find out if mine is correct and how to finish it.</p>

<p>Ok, it is easy to see that IFT won't work for the function $f$ because its derivative is zero on the line $y=x$. My idea is to modify the function.</p>

<p>Let $g(x) = x-\ln x$ and $F(x,y)=\frac{g(x)-g(y)}{x-y}$. We have $F=0 \Rightarrow f=0$. By Lagrange Theorem $F(x,y)=g'(c)$ where $c\in [x,y]$, thus by taking limit with $(x,y)\to (a,a)$ we have $F(a,a)=g'(a) = 1-\frac{1}{a}$. Hence $F$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}^2_+$.</p>

<p>Now let's show that it's $C^1$ class. We only need to show that derivative is continuous on the line $x=y$. We have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
&amp;\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(x,y) = \frac{(x-y)g'(x) -(g(x)-g(y))}{(x-y)^2}
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus
\begin{eqnarray*}
&amp;\lim _{h\to 0}\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(x+h,x) = 
\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{hg'(x+h) -(g(x+h)-g(x))}{h^2} =\\
&amp;\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{hg'(x) + h^2g''(x)- hg'(x) - \frac{1}{2}h^2g''(x) +o(h^2)}{h^2}=\frac{1}{2}g''(x)= \frac{1}{2x^2}
\end{eqnarray*}
We can do the same for $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \Rightarrow$ F has continuous paritial derivatives, hence is of class $C^1$. Moreover $DF(x,y)=(0,0) \Rightarrow \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}=0 \Rightarrow \frac{g'(x)-g'(y)}{x-y}=0 \Rightarrow x=y$ but $DF(x,x)\neq (0,0)$ for $x&gt;0$ (which was proven above). So, $DF(x,y)\neq (0,0)$ for all $(x,y)$.</p>

<p>Hence we can apply IFT: there exists a $\delta &gt;0$ and $C^1$ class function $h:(1-\delta,1+ \delta):\ F(1+x,h(1+x))=0 \Rightarrow f(1+x,h(1+x))=0$. Now we can define $\varphi(x) := \frac{h(x+1)-1}{x}$. All we need o do is to check that $\varphi$ satisfies task conditions. We can write Taylor series for $h$ around the point $(x,y)=(1,1)$ (since we know that $DF(1,1)=(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$) and obtain: $\frac{h(x+1)-1}{x} = \frac{1+2x+o(x)-1}{x} \to 2$ as $x\to 0$. </p>

<p>Here the trouble begins:
$\varphi$ doesn't satisfy the conditions but it would suffice to take $\bar{F}=-F(x,y)$ instead of $F(x,y)$ and $\bar{h}:\bar{F}(x,\bar{h}(x))=0$, then $\phi := \frac{\bar{h}(x+1)-1}{x} \to -2$ as $x\to 0$ so we can handle this problem. But how to show that $\varphi$ has continuous derivative at $x=0$? Do we have to compute the second Taylor polynomial for $h$? It's possible but seems like a lot of calculations..</p>

<p>I came across this problem on my calculus exam two days ago and it was only a part of a bigger one, so I don't believe the answer is that convoluted. It is the only thing I couldn't figure out so I would appreciate any help. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> BTW: It should be true for any locally non-constant $C^1$ function $f$, that around it's local maxima/minima there exists a non-identity $C^1$ function $g$ that $f(a+x)=f(a+xg(x))$ for $x$ from neighbourhood of that maxima/minima - $a$. So the task is only a special case of this theorem, am I right?</p>

<p>I understand up to $(1)$. In the previous line, I realize that $v=\frac{dx}{dt}$, but shouldn't $(1)$ have then been $\frac{dv}{dx} v$? Why is it acceptable to move $v$ to the left side of the differential; $v$ depends on $x$ and so will be operated on by it, won't it?</p>

<p>Accepting $(1)$, I don't understand how to get to $(2)$. I expect it has something to do with integrating $v$ so it can be moved to the right side; that would account for the $\frac{1}{2}$ and $v^2$, but I don't know the principle that makes $\frac{dv}{dx} v^2 = \frac{dv^2}{dx}$.</p>
